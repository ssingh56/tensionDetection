## Tension Detection and Analysis Interview Text using NLTK, NLP, Pandas, Scikit-Learn

● Performed descriptive statistics and analysis to determine major contributors for tension detection in interview text

● Analysis depicted emotion recognition, hedge detection, booster words & discourse markers as major tension detection factors

● Built classification models to predict tension labels in interview text with 78% accuracy, 68% precision & 80% recall


Interviews are a way of social interaction that can occur between two or more individuals who can be from diverse backgrounds. Many times, situations arise in an interview that leads to a stressful environment. Tension analysis helps to reveal a lot about the interviewee's personal quality, intelligence, and life.
The goal of this project is to attempt a descriptive analysis on the text data of various Interview text files and determine which factors contribute to 'Tension' and 'No Tension' sentences. We applied existing supervised machine learning algorithms on the interview text files and checked if we can correctly predict the right labels for the answer sentences. We tried several models, including Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Linear SVM, Decision trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. In addition to this, we tried out different feature subsets, including the subjectivity feature subset, negation feature subset, and bag of most common words. We also implemented Vader lexicon and opinion lexicon, which helped us in refining our results. In the end, we compared all the model performance to find the most accurate model and make our conclusions. The model which performed the best for our analysis was Gradient Boosting.
