       "'I think I have a special connection with my little sister Anne-Lise. We all complement each other in some ways, in the sense that at some point in time and in some circumstances my big brother may be the one to inspire me, at another point, it could be my big sister or my little sister—it depends. We are close. Sometimes it is simply the people who are around us and available that inspire us or give us strength. But I have a special connection with my little sister who was born after me, Anne-Lise, because it was just me, her and Dad during the period of separation from Mom and the other brothers and sisters. Maybe I feel a little bit like a mother to her. At the same time, her and I, we complement each other in some ways: sometimes she would say something and I will complete her sentence, at other times I would think about something and she completes my thought. Something was created between us during that period, I can’t explain what it is, but I’d say it’s a good relationship.If I have to talk about my childhood—I was born in Burundi in 1982 and when I was little, we moved to Rwanda. Dad was working in Burundi and he got a promotion in Rwanda, he went to work in Rwanda, I was one year old when we arrived in Rwanda. I’m not going to lie, I don’t remember much from when I was little, because I think I was too young. The only memory I have of Rwanda…of course, I played with the neighbours, with friends, with other kids, and so on. I remember the smells, the fences of the houses, the colours the doors were painted, things like that. And at the age of seven, I started school in first grade. When I was seven, I remember the road we had to walk to school; I remember my teacher who was very severe, he was old, old, old, but he was very, very severe. I have very few memories of Rwanda, because I left Rwanda at the age of eight to return to Burundi. But I can say that my childhood was like that of the other children: I had many toys… Most of my memories are from Burundi, not from Rwanda.Actually, I went to Burundi to join my sister, my aunts and my grandparents, but my older brother and sister, who were still going to school, remained with my parents in Rwanda. My mother had just had a fifth child, little Nelly. Surely, my parents weren’t going to move [to Burundi] because their lives were in Rwanda. We felt like we were on vacation, but since the situation [in Rwanda] wasn’t good, my dad wanted us to stay in Burundi. I think that things got much worse in 1992, especially in the area where we lived. Dad received threats, things like that. Once, he was even imprisoned for, like, 24 hours. And that was enough for Dad to want to protect our family. Some people had their houses attacked, some of the houses in our neighbourhood were burned down, it was…I remember that time rather well…we lived in Rwanda, in the Kicukiro neighbourhood, I think, I’m not sure…yeah, Kicukiro was where we lived. I remember there was a cemetery nearby and the [attackers] would hide in the cemetery during the night and would then attack the houses while people were asleep. It was quite dangerous. And my father was clearly a wanted man, to be killed during that time. So, in 1992, when…in hindsight, I think, “1992—that’s quite early.” But things were underway. What happened was that Dad…my mom’s big brother had been living here, in Canada, for a few years—he had been here for over five years at that point—and he was doing everything possible to bring Mom and the children here so that they can escape any further violence. So, Mom came here with the children in February 1992. And Dad found a way to join us in Burundi and then travel here. So, between 1990 and 1995…in fact, we were separated from Mom for five years, but Dad was with us from 1992 to 1995, while Mom was here.It was a little bit more complicated than that. When Dad arrived [in Burundi], he stayed with my two aunts who had younger children, and he was in the process of getting us to Canada to join Mom. But it was complicated—I don’t know if it was because of the documents or something else. The situation was safe in Burundi, but not in Rwanda, however, in Burundi too, the times were hard, especially for Rwandan immigrants. We weren’t accepted in Burundi either, especially at school. And Dad…he had applied to come to Canada, and he was offered to go to Kenya to speed up the process. So, we separated from our two aunts, but one of the aunts came with us. We went to Kenya, and we were there for about a year and a half with Dad, me, my little sister, my aunt and her little boy. We spent some time in Kenya, a year and a half, with our suitcases ready because we could leave for Canada at any moment. It really was a peculiar time. After three months, Dad said, “Well, listen, we’re not going to stay here and do nothing, you’re going to school.” So, for a year, we went to school in Kenya. I remember that school year: a new language, new friends, new food, and so on. It was a bit difficult, but when you’re a child, I think you adapt quickly.I think I’m realizing now, in hindsight, that it was difficult. When you’re in the moment…it’s very particular, you know, I don’t know how I can explain that, in the sense that…in Burundi, we had a maid who did a little bit of everything, who helped us get everything organized. But sometimes my grandmother would give her a break so that we could do our own beds, do the house chores ourselves, and so on. We were very spoiled in Burundi, so we were…but sometimes we did…in Kenya, we didn’t have a maid, which meant that we had to do everything ourselves. My dad and my aunt were busy trying to get the necessary documents, fill them in, do the interviews, and all that stuff. So, I found myself again being the big sister, but this time, we had to do everything: we cooked, we washed our clothes, we walked to school. It was [dynamic?] but…it was more difficult in Kenya than in Burundi, but, again, this situation taught us a lesson. I still remember when I was in Kenya, my little sister had—it was 1993, or around that time—we were going to school and we were preparing to come to Canada, and I remember that everyone in school had their hair shaved, even the girls, even the teachers—they had short hair, very, very short hair. And Dad asked if we could keep our braids, since we would eventually be coming to Canada, to avoid a potential shock for us. In Burundi we braided our hair, but not in Kenya, because the school we were going to was a private and more strict school, and everyone had their heads shaved, except us. So, we became the laughing stock of our friends: “Ah, immigrants,” and so on. We made small braids—so small, lying so flat on our heads that it looked like we didn’t have any hair, but we had small flat braids. All the same, we had little pigtails [laughter] and the kids from our class were pulling our pigtails, things like that. I also remember how lazy my sister was—she was also very young—but so lazy. We had to leave early to go to school, so sometimes I would wake up, I would wash her face and put her on my back and be on my to school. I didn’t want to be late because they hit us at that school, they would hit us if we arrived late, things like that. So, I would tell her, “No, no, I’m not going to get the cane today.” I would rather carry her on my back. We would run towards the school, on our way, and after we arrived, I would place her in her classroom and then I would go to my class. It was…in hindsight this makes me laugh, because it’s funny to imagine that scene. This lasted for a year and a half, but it was intense, it was special. I remember other little things from Kenya as well, our friends. All these things from childhood that I am telling you about happened as much in the community as in the church. So, something was giving us faith and the confidence to tell each other that it would all end soon, that we would join Mom, that it will all be okay. We had faith, we had that confidence.My father was in the choir, but since we were always around when they came over to our house, we ended up joining the choir too. [laughter] We didn’t know how [it happened], we only knew a few songs, and they said, “Do you want to do a solo?” Our voices were young voices, and sometimes we sang small solos in the church. Slowly, I was beginning to love singing. This didn’t last for long and I can’t say that we were part of the choir, but we had a place in the choir. We performed maybe three times a year, but we always practiced with them.Religion has had a very…it has influenced me positively. Well, I am religious, I grew up in the Adventist church, I’m a Seventh-Day Adventist, we pray on Saturdays. We follow [the rules] a little bit like the Jewish people, if I can say it that way: we are supposed to observe Sabbath from sunset on Friday night to sunset on Saturday night, so it really is a day of complete rest. We don’t watch TV, no cleaning—we would read, make jokes. The choir came over on those days, so we would sing, we would praise the Lord, and all that. Dad never forced us to go to church—it came naturally to me, it was like a feeling of national belonging. How can I say that? It is innate. I can’t say that I became Christian, I was born in it, and I identify as Christian. It [teaches you] important values, personally I am guided by these values: respect, patience, love, helping others, service, and all that. These are things that motivate me as a person, they are things that I have seen, that I have lived with and that, I think, allow me to be who I am, in a certain sense. Besides, I think that if we didn’t have religion, it would have been very difficult for us, the children, to understand why we weren’t with our mom, to understand why…there are many small acts of injustice when you’re a child; there is also favoritism when you’re younger…and sometimes my aunt was too busy to give us a hug. You know, as a child, you experience small frustrations like that. I think that going through that period in our lives helped us a lot. We weren’t little girls who prayed every night saying “Oh, thank you, Lord!” Our faith was a bit…we believed in God, we knew that everything was fine. Even if something was hurting us, we would say that it was going to be okay: “I think it’ll be okay.” That’s how we would encourage each other, but it wasn’t forced, it wasn’t something that we were forcing ourselves to do. And the other special thing was that our two aunts who lived with us in Burundi were Catholic, and they took us to church on Sundays. Then on Dad’s side, who was an Adventist, we went to church on Saturdays. So, we spent our weekends in church. We could compare the two and have an open mind about other religions too. I remember, the second time I went to the Catholic church, I saw that every Sunday they received the Host. I thought, “But for us, it’s once every three months—you can’t waste the body of Christ!” At the same time, I was asking questions, trying to understand. And at one point she said to me, “But if you want, you can take one too.” I did and I said, “But your Host doesn’t taste like anything!”—as children, we liked to compare things like that. This allowed me to grow up with religion despite the fact that we were going through a difficult time. And now, when I look back at that time, I think that’s one of the things that helped us stay strong.We left Kenya to come here because it was, indeed…the process was faster. Dad started the process in Rwanda, then continued in Burundi for a year and then in Kenya for another year. The wheels really got in motion in Kenya and we were able to—if I can describe it this way—travel across Africa in order to arrive in North America. We arrived in 1995, in March 1995, I remember very well. It was so cold! But our time in Kenya passed by very fast because the adults were working and us, the children, we would come home late and we played on the weekends, after Mass, after we’ve been to church, and all that. In Kenya we only went to the Adventist church because our aunts and grandmother weren’t with us there. I learned Swahili in Kenya and English, among others, I learned it there.When we were in Africa and people spoke to us about Canada, it sounded so beautiful, and everything. My mother was telling me, “Oh, the milk is free [here].” My little brothers and sisters…my big brother and my big sister were saying, “Oh, you open up one tap and you get milk, you open up another and you get water. There are soldiers everywhere!” So, it sounded a bit like an unreal place. And they kept dazzling us so much that we thought it was heaven. But I think my big brother was doing that on purpose, to make us want to get here faster. My big brother has always been a bit of a comedian, he has always had a sense of humour, really, since he was young, he’d say things that were pretty out there, thank you very much. But when we arrived in Canada in 1995, Dad had dressed us all up like pretty dolls—with little ponytails, little dresses, little sandals. We arrived at the airport—fortunately, there was a shuttle bus to pick us up because the plane landed super far. In the shuttle, I saw people putting on coats and everything, scarves. And then there was us in the shuttle, freezing, you know! And the shuttle drove for ten minutes from where the plane had landed to the airport, to where we were going to get off the shuttle. Once again, luckily, it was like a tunnel—you couldn’t see outside, you couldn’t really feel the cold, but you could sense that it was chilly. From the shuttle, we went inside the building. Mom was upstairs, she could see us, and she said, “Oh God, you’re going to freeze to death.” She had brought plenty of coats with her, and I was like…and so we arrived, many people were there to greet us, friends of my mom’s, and they had brought apples, pears—all Canadian fruits, it was okay. We tasted the fruits, Mom gave us the coats, but we were saying, “No, no, no” because we were so excited, so…we didn’t even know anymore what emotions we were feeling. We hadn’t seen Mom in three years, she had become quite hefty, she had put on weight—she was thin before—her hair was now long. I thought, “That’s not my mother.” [laughter] So, we were more focused on our reunion than on the coats. Then we got out of the airport and I felt a little bit of wind and I was, like, “What is this? What kind of a country is this? Are we in a fridge? I knew it was cold, but what happened in just a short time?” It really hits you directly in the bones, especially when you come from a sunny place, you really feel it in your bones. I remember my mother doing everything possible to cover us up, to protect us from the cold, and my dad was like, “Oh, darling…” We felt like we were in another world, with everyone around us trying to cover us up, and we were like…but, believe me, five minutes later we were shivering and if we hadn’t been careful, we would have ended up in the hospital, it was very cold. There was no snow, I think the temperature was six degrees, but it was intense. It was an intense welcome. Afterwards, we slowly integrated.We’ve been in Montreal since then. We lived in St-Léonard before, we settled in St- Léonard when we arrived. About six years ago, we moved. From 1995 to 2000, I believe, we were in St-Léonard; we lived in the same house after our arrival. And after 2000 we moved to another city, well, another Montreal neighbourhood, I should say, Parc-Extension. We get older, we grow up, we go our own ways—life goes by very fast. But we have always lived in Montreal.I think that it wasn’t as easy for them as it was for us, the children, because as children, we, like, grow up in society—you really do, you feel all the social [inaudible] and you adapt. For the parents it’s a different world. They come here, they already have, like, a career, they haven’t experienced all the difficulties of going to school here, and they’re looking for work, and so on. It was a bit difficult for my father. Why? Because, in Africa, since he was a pastor, he was used to visiting people. It’s different here, in Montreal, it’s a different dynamic—you can’t really visit someone without calling first, things like that. So, he had to accept that. At church we met mostly Haitians and we didn’t understand what they were saying—half of the Adventists here in Montreal are Haitians. We went to church and people would sometimes speak Creole there, while, before, we used to sing in our language and read the Bible in our language. That was a challenge for my father. He would say, “We’ve come here, but surely there must be other Rwandans here as well. We can open a Rwandan church and let them rent and worship, and all that. Because here, in this church, we don’t understand anything.” It was in French, but Creole is close to the French language. So, slowly, we started to understand Creole, to speak Creole. We started to eat Creole food and to dance to Creole music. And, following his idea, my father opened a church that was originally for Rwandans, but so many of his Haitian friends came to help us that the church became francophone, and now it’s a francophone church. Before we could do even a month of service in Kinyarwanda, other visitors started coming and we opened the church to everybody. On the professional side, it was more difficult for Dad because he had good qualifications in Rwanda, he worked with the biggest companies, he worked in the largest banks, the largest churches in Rwanda. Here, he had to go back to school, to learn French…he spoke a little bit of French, but, I mean, not enough to express himself with ease. So, professionally, it was a bit more difficult for him. He signed up for courses, he wanted to stay in the same field or work, then he wanted to start his own business. Him and Mom opened a daycare. They kept it going for a few years, but it was such exhausting work, it was so big that I think they stopped a few years later, maybe four years later, but that also…it was part of our youth, our childhood here. During our school years, they had that daycare, but it wasn’t [was?] at home, so we were always surrounded by children. We love having children at home—that changes the dynamic. After that, they stopped. Dad got a job in construction. They integrated—I can say that they’ve managed to integrate a little bit in their fields of work, but it wasn’t an easy thing to do. It wasn’t easy. They started from scratch, like everyone who comes here in Canada.Yes, my older sister Jeannette was part of a Rwandan dance group and my big brother Richard was on a soccer team, and we would go and cheer for them. We met other Rwandans, we grew up around other Rwandans, but Rwandan culture wasn’t the culture of my little sister and myself, since we grew up in Burundi and Kenya. So, I didn’t want to integrate too much with the other Rwandans, I don’t know why. I never understood why, but I just wanted to watch what they were doing, help them, encourage them, but I didn’t want to get into it. I hated Rwandan dancing—personally, I hated dancing. I thought it was beautiful, so wonderful, but I didn’t feel comfortable doing that dance. We accompanied my sister to dance practice and we saw some of our friends there and other young people, and everything. My big brother played soccer—they had many fans, and all that. So, we were part of the life of the community. As for me, I joined the community later on, it was around the year 2000 that I joined that community and became involved in the community, after witnessing a scene that moved me deeply, it was very touching, and I was like, “Wow, we have a beautiful culture! Oh, it’s beautiful!” After that I wanted to do some good, I wanted to help in the advancement of the culture, and I made an effort to integrate. I can say that, since the year 2000, I have more or less integrated in my community here in Montreal.Yes, it’s not a problem. It always feels good to socialize in our language, to make jokes, inside jokes, things like that, and, especially, to talk about culture and to discover things, because as I said, we didn’t grow up in Rwanda, and we lacked understanding of certain expressions—sopecya, if I may say that—to understand certain expressions, certain time periods and anecdotes [when told] by those who had grown up in Rwanda. We were missing that. We were in Burundi and of course there are other realities in Burundi that they aren’t familiar with, but there are also Rwandans here who grew up in Burundi and with whom we could share stories. And I think that has expanded the horizons of the community, of the culture—to fill, precisely, a small void, maybe, that we were missing—well, I speak from my own perspective—the things I’ve missed out on because I didn’t grow up in Rwanda.I think about it a lot. I think about it a lot. But does thinking about it mean actually doing it? No. Not necessarily. But if I could, I would go there every two years, spend at least a month or two months minimum. If I could, I would spend the whole summer there. If I could, I would spend six months there. If I could, I would spend a year there. There is something about Rwanda that draws me towards it, but I tell myself that in life you never know. I still think there might be, eventually, a possibility that I could work there for an indefinite period of time, that I could be of help there somehow, contribute in some way. I think about that a lot.I have no idea. I’m lucky to have my whole family here—I thank God every day for allowing us to…despite the separations and all the questions, and all that, we are still alive, we are still together. But we have relatives in Rwanda. Of my two grandmothers, the younger sister of the grandmother who died, is still alive; she is still in Rwanda. They are people who…when I was living in Burundi, I spent time with the two families: my aunts on my mother’s side and my two grandmothers on my father’s side, so I know them very, very well. My heart is in Rwanda, I don’t know why that is. I have relatives there, but we’re not very close—I have that grandmother, I have a cousin whom I met in 2007 and whom I liked, we got along very well, we really clicked. I phone people in Rwanda about once a month, just to hear from them, to ask how they’re doing and if we can do anything from here, things like that. I keep in touch with some people in Rwanda.Good things, good things. Despite the tragedy that occurred in Rwanda, Dad never taught us these things, in the sense that he never showed us the political differences. Dad never talked about politics at home. By the way, it was only after the genocide that we found out that we were Tutsi. That’s really…maybe this saved our lives in Burundi—we were friends with both Hutus and Tutsis because we had no…it was completely natural. Sometimes the Tutsi children would see us with the Hutus and would insult us, and our Hutu friends defended us—but we didn’t know why. We thought these were just small cliques, jealous of each other. At home, Dad never told us, “You are Tutsi, you are Hutu.” When we asked him—because sometimes our friends at school would ask us questions—Dad would say, “Well, you are Rwandan, what more is there to know? What do you want me to say? You’re Rwandan.” These are not the kind of things I would like to teach my children. It exists, and my children must know what it is, no matter what. However, it isn’t something that I want to emphasize either, and I think that I don’t like talking about politics, after all. Many questions surround this topic. My parents weren’t too involved in this and so they aren’t in the best position to shed light on this for me. I’ve looked for some answers on my own, trying to understand and everything, but it’s better not to fully understand some things in order to avoid being hurt even more, or to avoid creating ideas in your head. What happened? Why? Nobody knows why. And this has so destroyed the community that I don’t want my kids to grow up with it too. So, I will tell them about Rwanda, about peace, fraternity, sharing, culture, food, [traditional] clothing, things like that. I’ll tell them about our home, but I’m not going to tell them about…I won’t place too much emphasis on these things.When it happened, we were in Burundi with my aunts, and they protected us. We didn’t listen to the radio. Especially in 1992, while Mom was arriving in Canada, we didn’t have any news from Dad for six months and my aunts were worried that Dad had died during that time. We listened to the radio anyway, secretly, during the night. We knew the situation in Rwanda was very bad, and I remember that I prayed and that I said to God, “I don’t care what you give me or don’t give me, I want my dad to be alive.” Six months later, when Dad arrived [in Burundi], he had changed so much: he had lost weight, he had a beard and everything, and I didn’t recognize my father, I had hard time recognizing him. He arrived and said, “Oh, my daughter!” and I was, like, “Who are you?” Dad spent, like, a week sleeping, maybe because he had seen things, maybe from the exhaustion of the difficult time he had had, and all that. We didn’t know under what circumstances he had arrived in Burundi—he never told us that. I think I got lost in the question, excuse me…Yes, we went through it somehow, yes.Yes, but fortunately we didn’t see dead bodies, we didn’t see mutilations, we didn’t see atrocious things. Nothing happens for no reason—I can say that nothing happens without a reason. We could have been in Rwanda, we could have been killed. Later on, a neighbour told my father, “You were the first ones on the list. My house was the first on the list, yours was the second, and I was the leader who was supposed to cut people down. And you were first on the list.” Just hearing that, you don’t know what to say to life. You don’t know what to say to life. You just say “thank you,” because when I left for Burundi in 1990, that summer, things were beginning to happen. They arrested Dad, things like that, unfairly, and the gentleman said to Dad, “You wouldn’t have survived a month in Rwanda with your family.” So, if you’re a believer, you say, “Thank you, but why did you do this? But thank you anyway.” We didn’t deserve to be alive more than anyone else, but we are thankful to the Lord, and we try to be grateful to others in our lives. Many close friends, many relatives that we see every day have experienced traumatic moments, and they tell us about it. That reminds us again that we almost died.No, I think we covered it all, I think we covered it all. Thank you.This is the first time I kind of talk about it as a story, openly like that, yes, this is the first time. Sometimes we share little anecdotes, but in the family I don’t think there has been much room to talk about that, because we knew that Dad had lived through some very, very, very difficult moments, and perhaps we were waiting for the moment when he himself could bring it up. We never wanted to press on about what happened, or anything like that, especially since we weren’t there. Other people were telling us their stories. You know, if you weren’t physically present there during the genocide—like us, we were outside of the country—you keep thinking that you haven’t suffered, you keep thinking that your story is not important. And I remember that…by meeting with the people involved in this project, I am realizing that every person’s story is important. I wasn’t there when it happened, but our moving away was a result of these things. Talking about it allows you to understand that you have also lived through it in your own way. It allows you to express things, the unspoken things, or to just put things into words. We usually don’t stop and say, “Oh, I did this, I did that.” It can depend on a question that someone might ask you, and which then allows you to open up. And sometimes by telling your story, you realize that…I personally now realize things I hadn’t felt before. The emotion I now feel, this emotion, I didn’t know what had happened, and by telling the story, it opens up things, it becomes more clear to me. So, this is the first time I’ve told my story in this way and I think that this is the right setting for those of us who have experienced this situation to be able to talk about it, to verbalize our emotions.Absolutely, absolutely. Thank you to the project, because it’s…anyway, for me, personally, I feel that my story, no matter how big or small it may seem…every story is a story—big or small, it is still a story. Thanks to this project I realized that I too have something to say, in the sense that I think that every Rwandan has lived through this event in their own way. So, by just talking about it, you allow others to reflect on each person’s story. It helps to inform people about all aspects of what happened, like a broken mirror: everyone can look into the broken mirror, but each one of us will see a different object in each piece. So, everyone’s story becomes, like, a puzzle that completes the story of what happened in Rwanda.... My name is Berthe Kayitesi ... I am from Gisenyi in Rwanda. I was born in Gisenyi, but I spent part of my childhood with my maternal grandmother in the former Kibuye Prefecture ... the former commune of [inaudible]. ... my father\\'s name was [inaudible], my mother\\'s name was Mukabilima Spéciose, my grandmother\\'s name was [inaudible] Valérie. I think that’s [inaudible], I think that\\'s all.... of my mother, I remember her courage in the face of life’s difficulties, she was a fighter. She made sure that everything was going well at home, but she was also very strict, that’s the side of her I didn’t like. But I remember her strong character, her courage, her fighting spirit. That’s my lasting memory of her. For example, I remember that every day she would get up at almost five o\\'clock, five-thirty, and would start working. She advanced ... quite quickly in life. She often regretted not having been able to continue her studies, she always told me: “You know, I was smart, but I was unlucky, so ... you must ... ” [laughs]. And also: “I was at the top of my class. How come you allow yourself not to be ... to fail?” So, [laughs] we had to be among the best students in school. And when we weren’t, she was on our case ... [laughs], so to speak. She was also a very beautiful woman.... my father ... my father had a very gentle character and ... he’d had a difficult past, but he almost never expressed or shared his feelings. He was someone very warm, very, very hospitable—how should I say it—it\\'s really hard to describe my father. But ... it’s ... his calm disposition… he also had a certain hardness about him, but he had ... in fact, his kindness ... counterbalanced this hardness, and that’s how we remember him. Those who knew him retain that image of my father as someone who was very kind, someone who never complained. I think his father had been unfairly imprisoned for many years, but he never spoke of that. He had left ... well, he kept it all inside and he lived with these feelings, but without letting them affect the family. Thinking about it today, I wish he shared with us a little bit more of what he felt inside, but he had decided to keep it all within.... my father was a tailor, he was one of the first tailors in the region where he was born, in Kibuye, Gishyita, which he left to settle in Gisenyi and continued working as a tailor there, well, that’s what he continued doing until 1994. And as for my mother, she did many things. At one point we had a bar—actually, we had a bar at different times—and she was taking care of it. And shortly before 1994, she ... she was selling things, food, at the market.... the children also participated, so I think the work was ... shared. So, when my mother got up at five-thirty, sometimes it was because she had to get—how do you say that in French?—because the bar was also serving urwagwa, Mutzig and Primus ...... What they were both teaching us, I think it was equal, but for the most part, in terms of household work, it was my mother and me.... at the time, in 1994, well, when I returned to the house ... after living with my grandmother ... we were ... five. Later, my mother, well, my parents, had two more children so we were seven, but one of my younger sisters died just before the genocide. For us, the children, luck was on our side and we ... survived. The six of us survived. But my father had another marriage before ...... I think that Rwandan culture at the time ... favoured…—not only through education, but also through social discourse—it\\'s as if the boy child was more important than the girl child. [laughs] I remember, I was angered by this. But that’s over now. When I was born—so my paternal grandmother, actually, my paternal grandparents had five boys, so they didn’t have any girls. My father was their eldest son, and until I was born, he only had girls. [laughs] So when I was born—I was the first daughter of his second marriage—so my grandmother said, “Oh, it’s a girl again!” [laughs] And this made me angry. My mother had not picked up on that, but I did, and it made me angry a little bit. In our family too, as the older sibling and as a girl, I had more on my hands than my younger brother. For example, he could just go get water, but I was expected to do the rest ... and so there was disparity, but there wasn’t a ...—how can I say it—... it went without saying: you are a girl and so you do the housework. ... that\\'s how I saw things and then ... if my brother went out to play ... that’s okay, he can go play, he can go for a swim, I couldn’t go swimming ... [laughs] I had to be ...It’s not only an adult\\'s perspective, but also an outlook on Rwandan society from the outside. ... What I appreciate here, I think, is that we try to [laughs] treat both boys and girls in the same way. I don’t know if that’s something that has changed in Rwanda, but they’re making an effort to promote equality. I don’t know how things are in people’s homes, but at least in the social discourse we try to support girls as well, and in my view, this attitude produced through social discourse can also change things within families. I don’t know where we are at on this issue, but I think that if I had children I would try to have a more or less balanced approach, even though a boy can do things that a girl can’t necessarily do. But I think it’s a question of encouraging ... the child’s abilities and helping the child discover what it is that they want to do.... Well, yes, in the city where I lived. Maybe that wasn’t the case in the countryside, I don’t know. I think that women, girls would not be, for example … making bricks to build houses, so that was work for boys, but I\\'m talking about ... the way things were when I was 15. I think girls had more to do, but elsewhere maybe it was the boys who…, so I ...... One graduated from university and works at the Bank of Kigali. Another works for a private company and the others are in school. And even before, in terms of education, our parents ... this was true for all children; so my mother urged me to study in the same way she urged my brother, so there wasn’t really any imbalance there. It was more ... in terms of housework, but in terms of education, all of us, we were all encouraged to go to school.... I personally don’t remember my paternal grandparents very much, but I do remember my maternal grandmother. When I went to live with her—I don’t know how old I was, I think two years old or less, I don’t know—I remember that time, she gave me breast milk from her own breast until I was grown. And ... I remember that my grandmother was a very sociable person. She had already lost her husband so I never knew my maternal grandfather, but two of her children—my uncle and my aunt—lived in the area and I grew up with my cousins, my uncle’s and my aunt’s children, and I remember that on weekends we travelled far to visit my grandmother’s ... brother. Also, she was a farmer, so we had small fields all around the house and that was what occupied my time and what sustained us, but also her children who were close to her.In my own family. And I even think that [laughs] in a sense I remained a stranger [laughs]. You know, coming from life in the countryside and suddenly finding yourself in a big city where ...—before, I used to go in the fields or in the forest to collect wood for my grandmother—and then I arrived in a city where ... So I felt out of sync, I think, [?] yeah.Well, when you’re a child, you don’t think if it’s easy or not, you just go about your life. I can look at that time now, from the perspective of today, but back then I didn’t think whether it was difficult or not. Besides, I adapted very well during the first two years. It was as though I really wanted ... my feeling of nostalgia for my family was strong. Yeah.The neighbourhood where my grandmother lived was ... in Africa we say that the child belongs to the whole village, so I would go here and there in the neighbourhood and my grandmother was never worried about me. I could go to other families’ houses and so I was always out and about with the other children, herding the cows or fetching wood together and ... so that’s how life in the countryside was in my grandmother’s village. But once I moved to my parents\\' house, it was more like, You must not go ... to such and such ... People would not necessarily know who we were and I couldn’t go to the neighbours’ house like I did at ... like when I was at my grandmother\\'s. There were restrictions ... Luckily, sometimes—there were several houses in a ..., well, in a ...—how can I say this? [says the word in Kinyarwanda]. It\\'s like several apartments…Yes, a complex of houses and so we would also ... socialize with the neighbours, but it was really different. I think if I had a preference—in fact, I appreciate that I had both ...—but if I had to choose one, I would prefer the countryside, there was a certain freedom there [laughs] that we didn’t necessarily have in the city.... I don’t know. I don’t know. I learned later on—because I did stay for a short time with my paternal grandparents—I didn’t know them very well, but later, talking to people who knew them, I was told that my paternal grandmother was a very brave woman. During her lifetime, she was someone who was also ... a great fighter. When her husband was in prison, she kept the family together. She made everything look as if ... as if nothing was happening, while it was, after all, a family drama. She had to take care of her brother\\'s children who had just lost their parents. And, apparently, she was also quite strict [laughs]. ... So there are these two traits: the courage of my paternal grandmother and also her severity. I don’t know if we can say it’s this or that. I think I have inherited some traits from my father and I also have in me much from my mother’s personality, but I don’t know if my identity has been shaped by who they were or by the force of events, so it’s hard to say ... We are influenced by many things in life. I’ve probably kept qualities from both of them, but what happened to us is also a very important experience, which brought out aspects of our character that would have never come out had we not gone through these events. So, it\\'s hard for me to say … to say that my character was formed by this or that, I think it’s a bit of everything.Yes, or maybe that’s only an assumption, so I don’t know [laughs].... I think that my half-sister…—I connected with her later, after the genocide, two or three years—I think, I don’t remember exactly—but two or three years after the genocide. I had already lived with her in my parents’ house as the eldest of the family and I think it stayed that way.... I knew the twins who died. But the other sister, whom I found later, after the genocide, I didn’t know her in 1994. So, it\\'s… But I already knew her name because one day I looked at my father\\'s ID card and I saw a name written on it. I didn’t know who that was, but I remembered the name. And later someone said to me, “Oh, you know what? One of your sisters survived.” So I began looking for her.I think I didn’t have ... I don’t remember the things that I hated, but I know I liked school. ... I liked school very much. As for my relationships with the other kids—we played together. And I remember there was competition between us—who would be the best student in the class. We had to study a lot if we really wanted to have the highest rank. I was doing my best to be among those at the top, especially since I also felt pressure from my mother. I think it came naturally to me—I was learning quite quickly. And I think that when you are a good student relationships are formed more or less easily because the teacher likes you and your classmates do too ... those students who are more or less smart enjoy a certain respect and I think it [laughs] it played…, it allowed me to…Yes. Yes, they were always ... they were good to me, even if sometimes they told us to stand up as groups of Hutus and groups of Tutsis—everybody would stand up, but we were always a small minority of Tutsis so sometimes, [inaudible] the others were looking at us a little strange, but that was all it was. So we knew there was something, but it wasn’t explicit in the way they looked at us. And it was ... so, we would stand up and sit back down, and we would know in this way who was also Tutsi, but that was all, we would then carry on with our day.Yes ... No. Yes and no. [laughs] When I took the exam to get into high school, my mother said, “In any case you are Tutsi, so I would be surprised if you get a place in secondary school in Rwanda.” She asked her brother, my uncle who lived in Bukavu, to get me a place in a school in Bukavu so I could go study there. I went there and my uncle placed me in 6th grade in Bukavu. A few months later ... so I think that when I left [Nyundo]—I don’t remember exactly—but I think that when I left, the lists had just been released and I was not on the list of those who had passed the national examination. Later, my mother sent a letter to my uncle\\'s house saying that I had to go back because there was a second list and my name was on it. So I remember I started high school—I came back to Nyundo and I think the others had started classes a month and a half or two months earlier, and so I jumped on board with them.I think you know it, but you don’t understand it and you don’t dwell on it. So, when I try now to understand what those experiences meant to me back then, I think I knew it, ... but I was closing my eyes, so I think that I was living in denial. ... Already in 1990, there was in Gisenyi an operation called Operation Zulu, so Tutsi families—mostly those that were more or less well-off—were threatened and grenades were thrown. I remember that I was the only one in my family who had left home and I hid with the nuns and a few other children from Tutsi families near my elementary school; later, we left our hiding place. So we could see the ... it\\'s hard to interpret this today. I think the discrimination was there, but we ... we didn’t talk about it in my family and it was happening, it was going on, but it was surrounded by silence, and so we didn’t know ... why were grenades thrown at this or that place. We knew where it had happened, but we didn’t talk about it, and life went on. It was as if something had happened and then—silence. And I think we knew, we knew, but without understanding it or without necessarily attributing to it the importance that ... And our parents were trying to live with it, and that was the example we followed.Actually, for my grandfather, according to the information ... I’ve asked the people who knew most about it and they told me, “Someone killed somebody else and put the body in your grandfather’s field, and it was the Hutus from the village who did that.” So, it was related to ethnicity. That’s true in my mother’s case too, but she didn’t talk about it that much. We can’t know how she felt about that, what really happened, but there was a connection.Yes, I think that maybe they wanted to protect us. But it\\'s… Today, we can only look back and ask why we didn’t talk about it. And… In fact, why didn’t we know more? Why didn’t we discuss it to at least have a clear understanding of what was going on? But today we are stuck asking why. Why didn’t we revolt? Why didn’t we say, We\\'ll all follow my uncle? Why did we accept all of that?... In fact, I think it was already happening in the Gisenyi region. There was this period called Zulu. I don’t remember which year, but it was between 1980… I think it was 1993. But at the school where I was …, in high school in Nyundo ... very close to the cathedral, the Bishop of Nyundo at that time, the Monseigneur, had given refuge to the Bagogwe who had been chased from their region where ... well, from their homes. So when we went to Mass in Nyundo, we saw those refugees who were refugees inside their own country and who were there not because they were bad people, but because they were Tutsi. And so, in Gisenyi during this Operation Zulu…, I remember that after that period, many Tutsis who had the financial means left Gisenyi and moved to Kigali. And there were displaced children in my high school, displaced because of the war of the RPF [Rwanda Patriotic Front], and from time to time they were ... showing hatred for their Tutsi classmates. My classroom was ... actually ... I didn’t really see much … I didn’t see anything going on in the classroom. But since we were at a boarding school, we could see that small groups were forming. I remember one time, I was with two other girls, we walked by a small [group?] of children, some of whom had been displaced by the war, and I remember we saw them spit on the ground. But it was just ... it was an insult directed at us. At the junior seminary, there were things ...—the seminary was nearby—things of the same nature were happening there too. People, students, were sharing stories in the evenings. And the atmosphere was starting to get tense because of that. And, I think, when I look back at that time now, these are the kinds of events that foreshadowed the worst to come. But at the same time, I didn’t think about it too much. I don’t know if at some point you get used to living with things like this. But also, not all Hutu children were like that. I remember in one of my groups there was a girl, actually, several girls with whom we were often together and we never really noticed any animosity against us. So, those things were ... were there, they weren’t widespread yet, but we could really ... we could understand them if we wanted to see the situation as it really was. But, once again, you had to close your eyes and, you know, ... move on. When 1994 happened I was both lucky and unlucky. My luck was that I wasn’t at home. So, prior to 1994, I had run away from home and I had met some of the nuns from the Auxiliaries of the Apostolate, after which I returned home. So from time to time I would spend the holidays at the convent. And it was Easter in 1994, so I was going to spend my second week of vacation with these nuns. I left home on Easter Monday and the genocide began on the 7th. But I remember that already on the 6th, the night of the 6th, one of the priests came to pay a visit to one of his friends among the auxiliaries. And as he was there, we were told…—since the routine in this convent was to get up in the morning and go to the church to attend Mass. So every morning, we went to Mass. By chance, this priest was there and the priest said—actually, one of the nuns told me: “Since the priest is here, he’ll celebrate Mass at the convent, so you don’t have to go to the church tomorrow morning, the Mass will be held here.” So we got up to go to the Mass and the first thing the priest told us was, “The president’s plane has been shot down.” Everyone was ... I was surrounded by adults and later that day, sitting around the table, we continued discussing the news and I remember I said, “It’s over.” Today, every time I think about why I said “It\\'s over,” I don’t understand why I said it. And it was indeed over. I don’t know if that phrase was the expression of everything that I had seen until then and stockpiled in my mind. And then something else was going on in Gisenyi—there were these big buses that ... big buses that were transporting…It was the militia, I remember, but I think there was an odd euphemism used for them—people were calling them “the magicians.” So they were people who… They always filled the buses and sometimes, they were on top of the buses and they were dancing, you know, they were always making noise, they were singing. I had seen this frequently in my hometown, so…Yes, before 1994. And sometimes we watched them go by and we applauded—they were the magicians. So, I think all of that made me think “Okay, it’s over.” A few minutes later, the nuns were receiving phone calls informing them about the priests from this place and the nuns from that place…, what the situation was like outside, so on that day ... it began, the genocide began.And I said “It’s over” once more, but at the same time I didn’t really grasp the magnitude of this phrase, “it’s over,” and what they were saying. I remember I felt such fear around me that I ended up not being afraid anymore. All around me there was ... [laughs] there was really a feeling of terror, everyone was moving in all directions.There was panic ... you would be talking to someone and then they would go away. People were moving around. I’m trying to visualize it, I was saying, “It’s not possible!” So people were going up to the attic and I saw them coming down, they were looking for Félicité. “Hey, Mother, what\\'s going on? Do you have news of this or that person?” People would abruptly go into the room, they would go in ... and talk in low voices behind locked doors. Others would be listening to the radio ... they were trying to capture [?] to find out what was going on. Still others spent time in the chapel. And it was in this atmosphere…, but since I knew the house well… and actually, later the female students of Saint-Fidèle University also sought refuge at the convent and other people from the city who could reach the Saint-Pierre Centre, came as well. And since I was…, since I knew the place better than others, I continued to help. I helped with the cooking and with the housework. I continued participating in the life of the convent as I did before, so ... I kept myself busy and I didn’t really have time to stop. It’s only now that I stop and become frozen ... at that time, I was much more in the action. Félicité made sure that I had things to do, but she prohibited me from opening the door when someone rang—I always liked opening the door, but she prevented me from doing that.Yes, well, I went to see many of them, but she was the nun responsible for all others. But I was worried about my parents and especially about my father because a week prior to that he was attacked by militiamen and by soldiers in a bar, and on the way home we went to see him. My mother brought some money and I ... right away, I don’t know why, but I felt afraid for my father. And my mother was a sociable person and she had a lot of friends. I always had the impression that maybe… And she had an MRMD (the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development) membership card, but my father had an RPF card. I remember, when I was in Congo, my uncle told me: “Your mother has an MRMD membership card, she\\'s really brave!” [laughs] So, I thought that maybe that would save her. Because, later, I was afraid for everyone…, but right away, I felt that I was losing hope for my father. [wipes tears]No, life continued. Well, I can’t know everything that was going on in the communes, but we knew that the Tutsis were targeted, that it was about the Tutsis. I don’t remember being hustled by any of the Hutus who were in the convent. Even though Félicité and Nathalie went to—in fact, on account of these students from Saint-Fidèle —I remember they went to get another Saint-Fidèle student who was injured and was in the hospital and they brought her to the convent where she was treated. And Félicité had sent two Hutu nuns to my parents’ house. Upon their arrival, they found out that my parents had been killed, but they didn’t tell me that when they came back. And I don’t know if they had tried to save them or what, but I know that the next day Félicité asked me, “Do you know anyone in Congo? Do you, by any chance, have family there?” I said yes—that was around April 19–20. I told her that and she said “okay.” I think it was on the night of April 19 to 20 when she told me, “Don’t go to sleep tonight.” Actually prior to that date my brother had come—my younger brother, Jean-Baptiste, had arrived at the convent. And she told me that on the 7th, on April 7th, a classmate of mine from elementary school, whose brother was taking part in the killings [a génocidaire], had said, “You know what? All Tutsis will die.” And then my brother had told my parents, “I\\'m leaving.” And my mother had said, “Okay, go to this family.” One of my mother’s cousins had a husband whom we didn’t know if he was Hutu or Tutsi. Afterwards, I received written information confirming he was Tutsi, but at that time we thought he was Hutu. So, my ... then my mother had said [to my brother], “If you’re going there, take Marie-Ange with you.” And so…Yes, my sister. And so Jean-Baptiste went with Marie-Ange to Jacqueline’s house, but once there, Jacqueline\\'s husband told Jean-Baptiste: “We\\'ll keep Marie-Ange, but we can’t keep both of you. Do you know where Berthe is?” Jean-Baptiste said yes. “Okay, go to her.” So, Jean-Baptiste came to where I was staying, but on the way there, he met someone who asked him: “You are Alexis’ son, aren’t you?” My brother said, “No, I\\'m not Alexis’ son.” After that he arrived at the convent and so we were both staying there together. And one night Félicité told us not to go to bed. Later, around midnight, she came back and said: “Okay, you can go to sleep now, we were just told that there are militiamen everywhere and you can’t cross [the border].” She wanted us to cross over to Congo where she had sent about fifteen people already and she wanted to try that a second time, but it didn’t work. So until the 21st…, when the militiamen came to the convent, so around 3–4 pm… I was in the kitchen, and Félicité came running: “Tell everyone to hide, the assassins are here.” I ran around the convent saying, “Hide! Hide!” I hadn’t even finished saying that when the génocidaires arrived and I was then saying that I wasn’t Tutsi. They brought us to … one of them took me along with several others and there was ... they were people all over the place, so the militiamen had ordered many of the people to come out from their hiding places. I went to the exit door and I saw many people on their knees and a ... a killer pointing his rifle in their direction. They told us to kneel and we did. They had two minibuses parked outside the convent and we were told to get on the bus. I fought back. One of the killers was bringing people in ... and I said, “Don’t hit me.” Félicité hadn’t gotten on the bus yet, and they forced her to. So we left with the first bus and they told us that they were going to take us to the red commune. Inside the bus—one of the nuns had been teaching us a song—so I started singing it and then we were told to keep quiet because “You killed President Habyarimana, so you don’t get to sing. The only Hutu who’s on the bus can continue singing.” So, we took ... the driver took the road to the cemetery.That was the red commune. And on the way there, we saw that, outside, life for some people was ... continuing. While you are on the bus heading to certain death, right next to you—in any case, for the Hutus—life hadn’t changed, the market was open and you could see people in the street; at the time when you were afraid to come out of your hiding place and we were going to ... to the cemetery. And when we arrived, many people ... came to assist. On arrival, I also saw militiamen coming out of the [inaudible] with machetes, even with old, traditional machetes… And in the bus I had…, I had learned the name of one of the ... well, the name of the bus driver ... well, of my killer, a militiaman, and someone was saying ... who was saying, “But Thomas, don’t you recognize me? Don’t you know I\\'m from such and such a place?” I remember that. But I also remember that they didn’t really want to kill Félicité, because while we were driving, they said: “The colonel\\'s sister must not go on the bus.” But she had insisted, “If you\\'re going to kill these people, I\\'m going with them.” At the same time, even though the colonel\\'s sister had to get off the bus, they never forced her out—it was just empty words. So when we got to the cemetery, I thought, “Maybe they won’t kill her.” So I got off the bus, took her hand, and we all got out. The others got out and immediately lied down on the ground. One man, about thirty years old, tried to escape, but the génocidaires ran after him and caught him. It’s one of the most vicious images I have from that moment. They caught him and he was held on both sides by two génocidaires and two others ... were ... cutting him, and everyone was watching. So, in the meantime, Félicité, who, I imagine, didn’t really want to see that whole scene ... let go of my hand and she turned away…—the cemetery was at the foot of a mountain—and so she gazed up towards the mountain as if in a prayer. So, when she let go of my hand ... I took Thomas’ hands, the bus driver. And Thomas took my hand too. I saw in the crowd a former classmate of mine from elementary school, and I made a sign with my hand, like that [makes a sign with her hands] to ask for help and he did this [makes a sign of helplessness], meaning, he couldn’t do anything. And while Thomas was holding my hand, one of the killers snatched me from Thomas’ hands and Thomas kicked him. In the meantime we realized that Omar, who is now in Arusha, was shooting those who were lying on the ground. There was a child there, about two years old, and Thomas, who was holding my hand, told me to take the child and go back on the bus. A few of the génocidaires had stayed behind in the bus, there was also another girl in there—she was the child’s aunt, but she didn’t want to reveal her identity, anyways, the child’s aunt…Yes, the child’s aunt, the maternal aunt of the child I was holding in my arms. They were saying that the child’s father was Hutu, but the militia didn’t want to hear that. At the moment when I took the child to get on the bus, I saw Félicité falling to the ground, and at the same time I saw the priest—the same priest who celebrated Mass on the first day, who had stayed with us at the Saint-Pierre Centre—I saw him approaching with three policemen to save Félicité, but it was too late. So we got back on the bus and ... and it was over. Omar returned to the bus with Thomas, the driver, and we started on our way back. While we were driving Omar asked Thomas what was I doing in the bus and Thomas replied: “She just lied to me that she is Tutsi.” Omar said, “You have to stop the bus, I have to kill her too.” But Thomas didn’t ... didn’t stop the bus. We dropped Omar off at one of the big hotels in Gisenyi, Palm Beach, where I saw people ... people who were drinking, who were eating, so Omar joined them and Thomas then dropped me off at the Saint-Pierre Centre.Not to answer the question or: even though Félicité is dead, he saved two people. Surely, since Nathalie was angry and ... she was scolding him, he told her, “But I just saved…” Later, in the evening, the policemen who were there, apparently came back to protect me ... and they said … There were people still hiding in the convent who had heard the génocidaires saying, “Next time, we will burn it all down.” The génocidaires had said they would burn everything. And I began to regret not having died ... not having been shot dead in the cemetery. But that didn’t happen. The next day, actually, that same evening, several soldiers came by to ask how Félicité had died and it was as if she was the only person who had died. I tried to tell them what had happened, but I didn’t know that they had captured several of the killers. And the next day, Félicité\\'s brother and some of his friends went to dig up Félicité’s body and give her a dignified burial, among the thousands of dead bodies. And the people, the Hutu sisters who were there, later told us that all the corpses were naked. And on that same evening of April 22, we ... sought refuge in Congo. We decided ..., we decided to leave with the few people who were still at the convent. In the meantime, my brother had gone out of the convent and when he came back we told him to come to Congo with us, but he refused. He said, “I’m not going.” We woke him up around midnight and he said, “I\\'m not going anywhere.” And I knew that this was a serious mistake—but fortunately he survived…—to leave…So it’s… I don’t know, maybe we could have forced him to come with us since we were quite a small group, but he refused and we all left him there. I left with a feeling of guilt, but I\\'m lucky he survived, which eases that feeling a bit.I think it’s five minutes.It is, but that distance, during a genocide, becomes huge. Today, when I think about it, I wonder: “We had to wait for two weeks before we could cross over.” We were there, we could see Congo, so it was…I don’t know. I think you can be there in ten minutes. Normally, it’s three minutes to the border, but if you go through the fields, it may be ten minutes—in any case, it was really close. But during a genocide that distance becomes huge.Yes. We were about to arrive in a few moments and we slept on the ground in ... we were sitting on the grass, waiting for the sun to rise. Around five o\\'clock in the morning, we set out towards the houses in Birere, in Goma and we arrived at a church, I think it was a Pentecostal church. We went inside and ... those who were there could see that we were people escaping death. There was a Tutsi woman who was living in Congo and she decided to take care of me, and it was as if everyone found a place to go. There were several female students from Saint-Fidèle ... and there was one who was studying at the Adventist university at the time and she said, “I\\'m going over there to join the Adventists.” And I … When Félicité had asked me if I knew anyone in Congo, she was thinking of sending me first to Goma, to a nun who had left with the first group, among those who … And I said, “Can you take me to the bishop or do you know Adria?” And that’s how many of us were sent to different places. I was with Immaculée, one of the nuns who was Tutsi, and with Adria—actually, the nun brought us to the episcopal see in Goma where Adria and the other sisters came to see me. And we went to Adria’s family in Goma—there were several of us from the Saint-Pierre Centre. On May 3, the orphanage in Nyundo was evacuated. After our departure from the convent, Nathalie brought my brother and three other kids whose mother had left with the first group [inaudible] to this orphanage. So when the evacuees from the Nyundo orphanage arrived in Goma, my brother was among them. I then demanded to go to the orphanage in Goma and so we left this family and went to the orphanage. Later, in May ... my uncle who was in Bukavu, found out where I was and sent his wife to come and pick me up. But he thought that I was the only one there from the family. When his wife arrived and when she saw that my brother was also there, she said, “Okay, I\\'ll take you both to Bukavu.” ... So she signed me out from the orphanage to bring us to Bukavu. And on the same day we signed all the papers in order to leave the orphanage and after we left the orphanage and were going to spend the night in Goma before leaving the next day to Bukavu, ... my friends from the orphanage came to tell me, “Your three brothers just arrived at the orphanage with the Red Cross.” And so I went back to the orphanage. We couldn’t get a place in the orphanage again easily because there were many children there. But with luck, some would leave [and we could take their place]. I said, “I’m not leaving” ... they were trying to convince me that I had to leave because the director… that we couldn’t ... that we couldn’t have a place there anymore ... that the UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] had to sort this out. And we went back and forth to ... to the UNHCR and ... it wasn’t ... it really was a whirl of people trying to…, I [inaudible] who had other things to do and who told me: “Go! The children will stay at the orphanage and you ... you will go to your uncle’s.” I said that was not possible, so I [inaudible] [laughs]. At one point, there was a priest who intervened, Abbé Martin ... Abbé Martin who knew someone at the UNHCR, I think. The nuns, my uncle\\'s wife and I were in the process of trying to get permission, and then Martin intervened and after his intervention, the UNHCR ... allowed me to go back to the orphanage, and so we stayed there. Later, we returned to Rwanda with the other people from the orphanage.Yes. In the case of Marie-Ange, she had arrived in Congo with a wave of Hutu refugees. One of the Hutu nuns had gone to a [refugee] camp—I don’t know if she had stayed in this camp or not—she came to the orphanage and told me: “You know what? I just saw your little sister in a refugee camp, the [inaudible] refugee camp.” So, I accompanied this nun and she showed me where Marie-Ange and the family that had taken her in during the genocide were. And when I arrived, Jacqueline said, “You have to be very careful.” So, we found Marie-Ange who was ... not looking well, she had been jostled around. We took Marie-Ange from ... from the crowd of refugees and we went back together to the orphanage. So, that\\'s how we all reunited.Yes, that\\'s at least what my brothers knew. Later, when I was in high school ..., after the genocide, before I went back to Nyundo—I went to the Pentecostal high school ... in Gisenyi, the École normale primaire de Gacuga [?]—and that\\'s where I met someone who had seen them die, this girl who told me, “[inaudible] I saw your mother, they clubbed her until she died, your father was cut down with a machete.” It was ... it seems that it happened on her street and that there were also several Muslim men there who were playing gisoro and who tried to plead for my mother’s life, but ... it didn’t help or they were just pretending to want to help—I don’t know, that\\'s what she told me.[laughs] I’m an eternal rebel. I said to myself, “I will not stay here.” You know, you’re in the orphanage and you ... after I left [?] when the Notre Dame lycée opened in Nyundo, and since it was very close to the orphanage, I went back so that I can be closer to my brothers and sisters. But when you’re in the orphanage and then you go to high school, and everything is within a well-defined area, so you\\'re really ... it felt like two prisons and sometimes I would just leave, I would go to my uncle’s and my uncle [would say]: “But where is it that you are going? You have to stay at the orphanage.” And I would say, “Okay.” So, since my third year in secondary school, I’d had the idea to get out of the orphanage, and I was hoping that it would happen miraculously after high school [laughs]. So I studied like crazy in my third year, I never worked as hard in school as I worked that year. After the genocide, I thought, “I’ll finish school fast and I’ll leave the orphanage.” I thought that I would get a job right away and that everything would happen naturally. I made contacts with people outside of the orphanage. And later, when I learned that I had a half-sister and that she was living with her maternal aunt in Kigali, I went to look for her in Kigali and when I found her, she said: “Oh, I have a very good friend here and you must meet her before you go back to Nyundo.” So, [inaudible] she is my sister\\'s friend and she is really a very warm person and she told me, “If you want to come to my house during the school break, the doors are open.” And she was someone I had just met! [laughs] I said, “Okay.” So, from time to time during the holidays…, I ... we kept in touch. And 1997–1998 was ... the period of the infiltrators, it was still a dangerous time in Gisenyi. They were burning buses, so it really was another war. And I thought, “We can’t die now!” I was knocking on people’s doors, I couldn’t see ... I went to my maternal uncle in Bukavu and I said, “We can’t stay there, in this chaos of shooting. It might not seem scary to you, but if our fate is to die now, we should do everything we can so that at least some of us are saved.” My uncle tried to find an orphanage, but he wasn’t able to. And my friends, well, the families of my classmates were also trying to find an SOS orphanage in Kigali, but we made the mistake of saying that we were leaving one orphanage to go to another and the SOS told us, “We don’t take children from another orphanage.” So I didn’t know what to do, but I kept in touch with this woman and she told me, “You can bring your three sisters, Marie-Ange and, well, at least the youngest children.” And this was not something we did at home. It’s a family ..., well, after a genocide, anything is possible, but when I told my uncle about it, he said: “My goodness!” [laughs] And he turned to my two other brothers and asked: “So, what do you think—your sister is doing well, isn’t she?” But I didn’t care ... I didn’t care about what the others might say. I said to my younger brother, “You will sign as if…”—it was clear that my relation with the director of the orphanage was strained because of these comings and goings, so I didn’t dare showing up there and [I said to] my younger brother: “You\\'re going to sign as if it were my uncle, you\\'ll say that it\\'s my uncle who…”Yes. Or my uncle was forced to sign, I don’t remember exactly. In any case, it was on behalf of my uncle that we left the orphanage ... actually, my two youngest brothers and Marie-Ange left the orphanage to go to this other family. I stayed in Nyundo, and it didn’t matter whether my other brothers and I were going to finish high school or not, because I was comforted to know that at least some of us from the family would survive. So, Jean-Baptiste, Gaétan and I remained in Nyundo since they too were in high school—in the art school and I was in the lycée. And Marie-Ange, Jean-Yves and Yvan were [inaudible] in primary school in Muhima and they went to live [inaudible] with this family that we had just met [laughs]. During the holidays, I would visit my youngest brothers and my sister and then I would go back to Nyundo, and I was doing that until I graduated.There was a sort of madness to it too, I don’t think that if I found myself in the same situation now I would do the same thing.[laughs] That\\'s when we really became children, well, children and one head of the household. We settled there, we had the rent, but that was it [laughs].Yes. We also had to jump through many hoops. It\\'s really hard to explain, but it worked [laughs]. They told us, “Rent a house for no more than 25,000 Rwandan Francs.” We found one for 15,000 FRw, 15,000 francs and so we saved 10,000, but that’s cheating, so it wasn’t ... Well, afterwards I didn’t care since we did the deal without ... agreement with the owner of the house. I did the deal with Donatille who had hosted us in her house and ... with another mom who was with us … in this together.Later, the owner of the house found out about it and she went to the FARG. I told the FARG, “I don’t care. You knew that you had given us a house.” Her complaints did not amount to anything since she had her 15,000 FRw anyway. But life in that house—that’s where things got really difficult and I thought, “Why did we leave the orphanage?” At that moment, when we started living by ourselves, I was having regrets.Yes. Sometimes I would go to my uncle’s ... who was helping us out, but there were many of us, so it wasn’t really ... it was more or less regular help, but it wasn’t enough. At other times friends also helped, I sent letters to strangers, to people I was corresponding with when I was at the orphanage, and this was more or less fruitful. [laughs] Today I avoid thinking about that time, because I don’t know how we went through that period. But at the same time, well, when we were in that situation, we didn’t perceive it as alarming, which means that my brain was working all the time: Where will I be going today? I\\'m going to Ibuka again, and one time they sent me to [inaudible]. Tomorrow I\\'m going to ... So it was always…It was around the time when I started university, so I also had to cover transportation costs to the university. My brothers were still at the boarding school, well, some of them were still in primary school, but we had a very good neighbourhood, so there were also [inaudible], there was another family of orphans who were heads of their household, but their parents had died of illness and we were really supportive. And we had fields, we planted things, sometimes, we shared. But it wasn’t ... you know, it was harvest season, so there wasn’t a day when we went to bed without having eaten. But when we would be able to eat was—how can I say this—it was both luck and it wasn’t at the same time.Yes. Afterwards, I think my brain worked like ... Today, I feel like my brain is frozen, but at that time it was—whew!I think it lasted about a year, since I ... I also knew that my aunts had survived, my maternal aunts had Hutu husbands, and so I went looking for them. And at the time when I went to look for them, I was also ... working on a project of [inaudible] that the FARG had ... At one point the FARG told us, “We can’t just keep giving you charity, you have to do a project.” So we did a project ... to help ourselves, but that was also the time when I went searching for our maternal aunts. One of our aunts had a good situation at the time, and when she came to see us, she said, “Okay, but there’s three of us in the family. Why don’t you split—everything is going to be simpler that way?” So ... and Donatille said to me: “That\\'s not good.” But I was all excited to have found more relatives, and I think that was a serious mistake I made with regards to my younger brothers. So I said, “Okay, we can disperse within the family.” We split—I think it was in 2001, so from 1999 until 2001 we were ... or until mid-2000 we were alone. So the aunts…, so we dispersed. I went to live close to the university with my university colleagues and my brothers were in the host families, so at my aunts’ houses. But one of the aunts had AIDS and we didn’t know that, and shortly afterwards she ... she died. And it was she who, at least financially ... she had a difficult character, but she helped us a lot financially, she supported just about everyone. And that\\'s when it became difficult because it was this other aunt who then took care of my brothers. That aunt had a husband in prison, so she had her own problems. And she took in my brothers as well as the children of my aunt who had just died. So the children survivors were living with other children as well as with the children whose father was in prison—even if they were all family, it wasn’t easy. And my younger brothers Jean-Baptiste, Jean-Yves and Yvan suffered a lot. They stayed there until I graduated from university and, once again, I went to the FARG. At one point, it was like I was working at the FARG—I don’t know how many times I’ve been there. So after that, after graduation, I went back to the FARG and I was able to get the house in Kimironko where we are still today.Yes, one of them even ... the youngest, he often ran away from home and he was saying, “I want to live either with you or with my uncle.” And so I had promised…—when he would run away I would take him in sometimes and he would spend time with my university colleagues because I couldn’t [host him] at the time ... I had one room in the university dorm—I couldn’t. The other children were deeply affected, but we have a good laugh about it today. But things were not going well at all at the time. The second youngest, Jean-Yves, he was quite affected, while the youngest ... the youngest brother, who was running away—today we laugh about it—but he suffered a lot too, so I don’t know if there will be any further consequences later on, but today we’re able to laugh when we talk about that, and we talk about it from time to time.We were all there, but we evolved differently. So, it\\'s ... I think during the years when we were scattered around, there are things that happened in everyone\\'s life and I think that it—how can I say that—we love each other very much, but it\\'s as if ... it\\'s as if everyone has taken their path. So, to say that we shared family moments—such moments were missing [she is crying] ... and even today, each of us is still searching for who we are so it\\'s ... it\\'s again time to…One works in …, in the [inaudible], another works for an oil company, a third is waiting to get into university and the youngest fell very behind in school and is now in fourth year of secondary school. My half-sister is there… So they see each other, they were telling me ..., the boys prefer to go out rather than just sit at home with the youngest brother, but life goes on ... there’s no comparison with what was before, things are happening ... things are looking up.Yes, I\\'m trying to let go, but for the child who is in his third [fourth?] year in secondary school and ... well, for the two youngest brothers, I still try to be there for them as before.Actually, I think it adds a sort of [inaudible] to a person’s sense of self. I have a hard time thinking of myself as either a sister or a parent as [inaudible] it\\'s ... I\\'m swaying between the two. And it\\'s also paradoxical—now that I don’t have all these responsibilities, it\\'s as if I’ve become childish, at times I feel more ... [laughs].I think it\\'s both. It’s a situation that makes you vulnerable, so now that I don’t have to spring into action or in my way of doing things sometimes, I realize, “But that’s really childish!” [laughs] At the same time, I also say to myself, “Allow yourself to finally be a child, if you can.” Still, if I act like that around other people, they might find it strange that at my age I react in a childish manner. And so, it\\'s ... I think about that, but these things happen spontaneously, so it\\'s not ... it\\'s not an easy topic. I think I have a divided identity.... I think there were many people like that and ... at different moments. I think, for example, before 1994, when I met Félicité and the other nuns, it was initially another nun who introduced me to Félicité and she was around 60 years old. At the time I was only 11 and I was dealing with family situations that I didn’t accept and she welcomed me and took the time to talk to me as if she was talking to an equal and she treated me ... treated me with me a very positive attitude, a compassionate and welcoming disposition. And especially ... to also see how she treated everyone, not just me. She was someone who ... who knew ... who took care of some of the vulnerable people in the town. I remember there was an elderly woman who did not leave her home and that nun was taking care of her. She was paying someone to stay with the lady—I think one of the other nuns was staying with her, but she supported the elderly lady in her needs. It was the nun’s simplicity and especially her disposition towards others that were remarkable. And during the genocide nothing in her behaviour changed. And I think that knowing that—despite how broken we were by the events—I think knowing that gave me confidence in life, as if no matter what happens, I don’t have to necessarily expect the worst and I can believe that even one individual among the thousands can spark brightness. Later, whether at the orphanage or at school, I was lucky to have teachers who always listened to me, who always appreciated me as a student, well, I could see they loved me and that, I think, carried me forward. Also my schoolmates, even when leaving the orphanage, even when ... many people were saying “This child won’t get anywhere. She’s taking her younger brothers out of the orphanage. What will happen to her? She will become mayibobo, she will become ikirara, a street child.” Despite that, my classmates who knew me, and even their families whom I got to know through my classmates, were supportive. And then there was Donatille and her husband Fénariel who welcomed us without knowing us. Donatille was someone exceptional, she was ... a very kind, very generous woman who was really there for us during a difficult time. We ... it\\'s as if we were sisters, we didn’t know each other, but she regarded me as her younger sister and she loved my little brothers as she loved her own children. So, there were many positive things. Today, we’ve moved past this situation and when we look back on it we realize that it has weakened us, but that there were a lot of things that ... that, despite our vulnerability at the time, helped us get where we are today. So, I think that\\'s it. Life here or there, well ... I was living in that situation, but I can’t say that ... that it was dramatic. Perhaps it seemed dramatic on the outside, to the people observing the situation, but I never experienced that. Our situation was what it was, I couldn’t stop and analyze it, so I lived with it and I carried on. But it\\'s really thanks to ... to all these people that I’ve met. And then, when I arrived here, you were here, Emmanuel and Callixte were also here.... Actually, after my studies in Rwanda, I got a job in [inaudible] in Kibuye ... but I liked to study, so I entertained the idea that if the opportunity presents itself, I will continue studying. So, I learned that there were scholarships for students from the Francophonie, I applied and I was lucky to get one. The destination was Canada. So that\\'s how we ... [laughs]Yes, I came as a student. I arrived in Trois-Rivières and I think that was the moment when I started to look back and to see that it wasn’t ... a normal or an ordinary situation. And that’s ... how I could get in touch with Emmanuel and with Callixte with whom I spoke, I think, in the first months after my arrival in Canada. And that’s how it happened. Emmanuel and Callixte asked me to share this experience in public and so here I am with you today! [laughs]... I think a big part of me is still there ..., so I think I live here physically while I’m often there mentally. And even if it\\'s not there as a physical place, it\\'s there as an experience. So ... all the years I lived in Rwanda, that’s what ... made me who I am. I came here as a student, in conditions ... in good conditions, compared to everything I went through there. Being here has allowed me to go back…, well, it gave me the time to think about what I had experienced in Rwanda. In recent years…, actually, all the years that I’ve spent in Canada have been years of reflection. I don’t know if I’m really integrating in the culture here [laughs] or if I\\'m inside my shell. At the same time, I’m starting to have a social network in this country—I have friends in Trois-Rivières, people from my cohort in graduate school, people from my summer work, people from the place where I teach French in the summer, so I meet a lot of people, and I embrace ... I more or less embrace the culture here, Western culture. I also think that having shared my experience on different occasions ... I think that has also allowed me to ... to adapt, in a way, to adapt by accepting … who I am. Although I should not remain in this role of a witness, because it’s a vulnerable position, but I ... being here as a student … has also been a kind of a stepping stone for me.Both at the same time. Well, there was ... when I arrived, Emmanuel wasn’t really here, he put me in touch with Callixte. But it was mainly with a couple of friends from France, who were also foreigners in this country, that I built a very strong friendship, right from the first months of our studies in Canada, and these friends later came to Rwanda and I went to visit them in France. So, with them it was ... and with other Québécois friends who joined our group towards the end of the master\\'s degree. It was ... it was much more the community ... So I think it\\'s both, it\\'s the Canadian community, well, the Western community, but also a large part of the Rwandan community. Actually, there wasn’t a Rwandan community in Trois-Rivières, but I was in contact with Page-Rwanda, although not regularly. And then I met Josée, Josée Gicali, who had known my paternal grandparents whom I didn’t know, and it…, it helped create a very strong bond between us. So she also helped me integrate in the first months, and later I expanded my horizons elsewhere.I think…, well, I’ve never compared them, it\\'s a bit of a difficult question, but I think it\\'s different. Most of the Rwandans I meet here are survivors so ... obviously [?] ... [laughs] we speak ... our language. I remember the first time I was in Quebec City before meeting other Rwandans, it was ... it was wonderful to see ... I was at this place where they were performing dances from different cultures—it amazed me to see my culture in Quebec. Most often, when Rwandans get together ... we talk as if we’re still in Rwanda ... we also talk about our experiences during the genocide, we talk about everything, actually. ... In the company of Canadians, we talk about a bit of everything as well and we share our experiences too, but our experiences are very different. So, they’ll talk to me about vacations and I\\'ll talk to them about Rwanda. Maybe I will slip in a few words about my experience ... During my first months in Canada, that’s all I was talking about and I felt overwhelmed, so today I don’t talk about it much. But at the time, I spoke about it often even to Canadians and to my French friends so it wasn’t ... But they are removed from my experience, so the conversation takes on another shape and there is a very big gap between what they tell me and what I tell them. Still, they were listening, they were very ... they didn’t rush or pressure me, well, I have been pressured, but not ... not on the part of these friends.I don’t know [laughs]. ... It\\'s a question of mutual acceptance. Sometimes we can be suspicious, thinking that Canadians haven’t lived through such major events, but ... they also have things to share ... I think it\\'s a question of ... opening up to the experience of others. But it shouldn’t go in one direction only: just because we’ve had a painful experience doesn’t mean that we should not listen in return. I think that the history of Canada also contains some traumatic events and I think that sometimes we must accept to open ourselves to positive experiences. And especially when we’re talking about a genocide, I think, it\\'s an issue, a phenomenon that is of concern to everyone. So during those conversations, it\\'s not only about listening or accepting my experience, but it\\'s much more about using this experience in relation to others, since, I think, genocides continue to happen, but they don’t happen twice in the same place. They always happen to other people, other places. So, I think that not only Canadians, but everyone has to become aware of our experience. That’s the greater usefulness of witness accounts— if possible, to protect others in other places.[laughs] ... I don’t know. It\\'s a difficult question ... I don’t know since ... I think that all Rwandans, well, every Rwandan has his or her own experience and I’m not sure that I should be asking them to think about me in a certain way. Perhaps I should be asking how we should all consider each other. I think everyone lives their experience in their own way, and we should maybe try to listen to each other and abstain from judging each other. What upsets me the most, I think, is to be judged: “Oh, you’ll become mayibobo.” The perception that others have of you can really weaken you and you might think, “Oh, maybe ... I really am like that.” We live in a society and, unfortunately, one downside that I ... that I’ve noticed often about our community is that we’re always looking on a surface level and ... not everyone is like that, but in general it seems that we’re focusing on what is wrong with the other person. So, in this case [inaudible] we need to always make the effort to bring out those qualities in others that can help them advance, not the ones that can knock them down. I\\'ve been knocked down to the ground enough times that I don’t see the point of, for example, sitting around and, you know, criticizing others: “You know what? Oh, now [inaudible] is constantly drinking. But why do they drink? It\\'s ... [inaudible] of orphaned children, it\\'s a catastrophe! All they do is make babies and do drugs. Why do they do drugs?” Why don’t we try to find out what’s wrong, instead of…, I mean, to try to focus on the good things.It\\'s also normal that we are more curious about the things that are not going well, but it\\'s just a matter of going further, of ... not stopping at that ... you can ... In the orphan village where my brothers and sisters live there are, say, two or three young mothers. When we see that the girl is pregnant, we might think that, for example, only orphans get pregnant. But that’s far from the truth! And it\\'s not just the orphans who drink a lot. People whose parents are still alive drink too. For me, that’s …I feel very nostalgic for certain places and people. I’m always afraid when I’m in Rwanda because I know that there are killers walking in the streets. Well, people who have killed back then and I don’t know if they won’t kill again. So I\\'m afraid. But it’s also with great joy that I return to the places I frequented for the most part of my life.No, but what I did find out, although I don’t know if it\\'s true, is that one of the killers died in Congo. A gentleman came to see me after the genocide to ask me to testify against someone who had been imprisoned and who had taken part in the killing. But when he came to see me…, well, I wasn’t there when my parents died, so it was difficult for me to testify against whomever ... I didn’t know that person, I had never seen him. But for the moment, we are looking for the bodies of my twin sisters who died in Bisesero. We haven’t found the place yet, but we’re looking.No, and for the time being, I don’t think I want to, anyway, at this point in my life, I don’t think I want to meet them. I know that my brothers sometimes go back there. And when I go back to Gisenyi I ... can’t bring myself to ... I went once where we…—actually twice, once to see if there were any photos left and a second time with my friends from France to show them the place. But we didn’t ... I didn’t stay long. I saw the neighbours who are still there, but I’m not really interested in ... staying in contact with them.Yeah, I don’t want to meet them, so I don’t know if I would have the strength to go to the Gacaca, but one of my brothers has gone. The people from the neighbourhood where we used to live were denying that we had lived there and were saying that they didn’t know our parents, so my brother had to go there. And while he was there words were exchanged that didn’t really make sense. The neighbours were saying, “Oh yes, that’s right, you are the son of [inaudible]. Oh, I wasn’t here during the genocide, I was ...”—I don’t know where they said they were. And so they started admitting that our parents really lived there, that we lived there. But they were also saying that everyone had moved away by the time my parents died. It\\'s a difficult subject. I think that the survivors would like to know more about certain aspects of what happened—for example, where the bodies are. But I don’t think that it really…, I don’t know if it has a healing effect. Someone who’s actually been at the Gacaca … will be able to say more about it, I think. Since I’ve never taken part in the Gacaca, I can’t say ...It concerns me personally and collectively speaking, so ... if I try to understand the politics behind it... I don’t really understand it ... I can’t find the words, but ... personally, I\\'m opposed to forgiveness, I’m opposed to reconciliation. That doesn’t mean that my heart is filled with hatred and that I want the killers to be killed, no. But I think I prefer ... to live with whomever I want to live, whether they are Hutu or Tutsi, but that it is me who decides. So if we choose to live with each other, we know we\\'ll have to deal with those questions and that’s a personal choice. But I can’t see myself meeting someone who has killed my father, who has cut him with a machete, and who says to me, “I cut him with the machete, forgive me.” So, I think ... I think, I won’t be going any further with ... the Gacaca. I see it as a policy that perhaps restricts choice. If I had to give a choice—the people who held the machetes and who were killing for months and months should be relocated and live elsewhere. I think that the survivors of the Rwandan genocide are a sacrificed generation, they see their killers day after day. I think it\\'s like ... inadvertently, this might be reinforcing their denial. With a crime like that ... justice has to be done first and I don’t know if the Gacaca bring real justice. And for this too it\\'s not really up to me to say, because I don’t have direct experience with it.I don’t know if I would address the young survivors specifically, since everyone is dealing with this experience in their own way, so I don’t want to assume the role of a counselor. But from my personal experience, some of which is shared by others, it is more important to convey a message ... to the young survivors’ circle of friends and family. And of course the survivors ... I think that every survivor’s story must be heard in the singularity of experience that it recounts, so I can’t come forward as an example or a model. Or if I am to be such an example, it is up to the young person to request it—it shouldn’t come from me. I think that\\'s the way to do it. But, more important to me is the message to [inaudible] the survivor’s circle of people. It\\'s ... to really listen intently, to try to understand. The experiences we\\'ve been through ... can change our outlook on life, can change our ways of ... our behaviour. So it’s up to the people around us to try to understand what is going on ... because what\\'s happening is not, sometimes ... necessarily under our control, you know, and so I can encourage the survivors to say nanana but ... [break in the recording]It\\'s really a question of solidarity and ... understanding each person’s experience in its singularity, even though it’s an experience shared by many survivors ... I think.I really don’t know if I would live there. Until I graduate, I’ll continue going back and forth. I don’t know where I\\'m going to settle in this world [laughs].... I think I need to continue with the process of recovery. I love Rwanda very much and I go back as much as I can, but for the moment I’m not planning to live there. That doesn’t mean that I won’t think about it tomorrow or in the future.Not really. But, it\\'s a question of how I feel when I\\'m there and how I feel when I\\'m here—that\\'s what will determine my return there or my choice of another place to live.I didn’t think about the questions [laughs]. I didn’t really think about the questions.Yes, I know, but, no, I think ... I think we covered everything ... Thank you. [laughs]... At times, it feels good to talk about it, but the moments right before, the preparatory stage, if you will, when we know we\\'re going into the conversation, is not always easy, especially when we talk about it often and when we become ... overly solicited [for interviews]. It\\'s like ... it\\'s as if we [inaudible] since we continuously go back to it, even though there are variations in the story, we often recount the same things. At the same time it\\'s up to me to decide not to talk about it. But sometimes, because we’ve become used to it, we can’t bring ourselves to say no. But ... at a certain point, it’s mentally exhausting. [End of the session]Habimana (E.H.): ...  Habimana, I\\'m ..., well, I live in Trois-Rivières where I teach in the Department of Psychology at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières. I arrived in Quebec in 1980 with my family. I don’t know what else you would like me to say as an introduction...?Yes, of course, I have great memories of my neighbours. It must be said that—to briefly summarize my story—the Rwandan tradition is—and I think that’s still the case [makes an expression of doubt], maybe less today, but in my day this was common—I didn’t grow up in my parents’ house. I was raised in my grandparents’ house. My grandmother was a widow and according to the custom, her children, especially the girls, sent one of their children to grandma’s to help with her work. It’s a way of supporting an elderly mother who is alone, with no one to help, by having someone there helping with her household chores. My mother was very attached to her mom, so she sent me to live there. But there are other, more complex, circumstances that motivated my mother to send me to my grandma\\'s house. It\\'s a very long story [smiles]. Let\\'s just say that I grew up in my grandmother\\'s house and I know better the neighbours on my maternal side of the family than on the paternal side where I didn’t really live. I spent my whole childhood with my maternal grandmother until I started high school, which was a boarding school, and later left the country.I grew up in Gikongoro, in the Commune of Karama, on a hill called Kiraro. That\\'s where my maternal grandparents were, while I was born in the neighbouring commune Rukondo, on the Kabirizi hill, where I later lived, although not for very long, when I was a little older, around the age of 13–15.It went really well. Primary school, high school ... I liked going to school, I was learning quite easily, it never required too much effort and I really liked school. The only bad memories I have from school are the holidays and vacations. I didn’t like holidays, I didn’t like vacations. I wanted to stay at school all the time. Maybe it was because during the holidays I had to do work around the house and in the field, and I didn’t like that. I liked studying. And my mother understood that very quickly. She realized that they shouldn’t expect much from me when it comes to skills for labour, like what the other children were doing—working in the fields, building the house, things like that. While my father pushed me to be a little bit more resourceful like the others, my mother said, “Leave my child alone.” So, often, when I went herding the cows, I would bring books with me. I would read—I loved reading when I was young. I started reading fairly early. Of course the other children, the other shepherds who saw me herding the cows and reading—sometimes the cows wandered off to other people’s properties, other people’s harvests because I was so absorbed by what I was reading. So the neighbours weren’t happy. But I was a weird kid. My father was a bit puzzled by this, but my mother’s attitude was like, “He’s an intellectual, let’s leave him alone.” But I liked school a lot, same thing for high school. I went to the Groupe Scolaire secondary school in Butare, which at the time was one of the best, if not the best, school in the country. I succeeded brilliantly. I was never the best student in the class. Far from it, I never had the ambition to be the best student. I just loved school. The teachers were teaching, I was learning, and time went on. I never did homework. I absorbed the material and I did the exams, I passed them without a problem. But my ambition has never been to be the top of my class. Not at all.After high school ... A little anecdote here: I\\'m a psychologist and this vocation manifested itself for me quite early and by chance. There was a Dominican-Canadian Brother who taught at the National University of Rwanda and he came to give a lecture in my class ... I think I was in my second or third year of high school. His lecture was on personality typologies, personality types. I was fascinated by his lecture and I said to myself, “One day I will study psychology.” Another anecdote: a few years earlier, maybe five-six years earlier, I was in second or third grade and our teacher had a younger brother who was studying in Leuven and his younger brother came to visit us in the classroom. I don’t remember what he told us, but I do remember him saying that he was studying in Leuven. I was probably 9 or 10 years old at the time. And I was looking at him—he was handsome, he was wearing a nice hat, he was well-dressed and in my fantasies of a young child I thought, “I too would like to go study in Leuven one day.” And when I finished high school, I went to study in Leuven. It\\'s really  a combination of circumstances that an old dream finally came true. At the time you could get a scholarship to study abroad if you had good grades, but, obviously, many students had good grades. I was one of them. I had good grades, and when the time came to award scholarships, I didn’t get one. I was sad because people who had worse academic record than mine were able to go; I was desperate. One of my cousins was married to the minister of education at the time. I went to see her, I begged, I said, “Could you ask your husband if I could have even a small chance to get a grant to go abroad?” She told her husband about it, and at the time the Rwandan government offered grants to some students. In any case, that year, Rwanda had sent a lot of students to Belgium, about 30 students, I think. They put me on the list. Many of the students came from the Gitarama region, that’s where the former president was from. The majority of students came from that area—and that minister, by the way, was from the same area. But because I was lucky enough to know the minister’s wife, I was one of the few students from another prefecture, Gikongoro, who left for Belgium. So it happened really by chance and a combination of circumstances, as it often happens in life.In high school, the tuition fees, called minerval—I would say they were relatively expensive for poor families because many young people didn’t have enough money to pay the minerval and they ended up not going to school, they dropped out because of that. So when I successfully completed elementary school, or rather, when I passed the exam to get into high school—I remember at the time one percent of students could go to high school. So I was among that one percent who could go to high school. My father ...—I can explain this later—my father wasn’t at home. He had gone to Uganda as a seasonal worker. In fact, what I realized afterwards was that when my father and my mother had a fight—she was strong-headed, she was very intelligent, she was domineering, she came from a very rich family, she was used to comfort, she had a great deal of self-esteem, so she was really domineering. My father, on the other hand, came from a modest family and he was very peaceful, he didn’t like drama, conflicts, so when my mother was fighting with him, he absolutely didn’t want to argue. He would leave. He would say that he was going to work to make some money—because at the time a lot of people went to Uganda—but he wasn’t really working, he would just travel around. He would make some money and then he would go travelling and when he returned home, he would tell me about his trips. He had travelled all of East Africa, up to Zanzibar in Tanzania. He travelled by train, he travelled by boat and every time he came back, he would say that the Rwandans think that they are intelligent, they think, they think that they know how things work, but that they know absolutely nothing. He looked at the Rwandans with disdain because he thought that they were self-absorbed and haven’t travelled at all. He would say, “I’ve travelled, I’ve seen many places, many, I’ve seen many countries.” He really had an open mind. So I think I got that from him. The curiosity, the travels, and also, the propensity for spending [smiles]. He’s someone who can’t save. When he had a little bit of money, he would leave, he would travel. So when I was accepted to high school, my father wasn’t there, he was away on his trips again and my mother asked her cousins for help. She came from a bourgeois family. Her cousins \\u200b\\u200bwere middle class, merchants. Her older brothers had large properties. It’s a really prosperous family. I remember, at my grandmother\\'s when I was young, there were so many cows that there were cows in the back yard, mu gikari, and mu rugo, in the front yard. And I remember when we were milking the cows, we filled jugs and jugs of milk and poor people often came by the house to ask for milk. It was the distribution of milk. We gave a portion of the land to people who were poor and hungry so they could have sweet potatoes, cassava. So a middle class family like that. My mother had grown up in this milieu, which was bourgeois and authoritarian as well, because I would say that she was quite authoritarian herself. So, I succeeded in school, and she thought, “I will ask my brothers, my cousins, they will help me so that my child can continue studying.” But they all refused because I was in the same school as their own children and I was the only one who had succeeded. So the children of her brothers and her cousins \\u200b\\u200bwho studied with me, none of them had succeeded to go to secondary school, while I, the foreign child—that’s my interpretation, which I made up later on—that I came from elsewhere. The child who came from elsewhere, had succeeded. So they thought, “Her husband is not there, they’re poor and if we don’t help them, this child won’t go to school.” So they sent my mother away empty-handed, and she only had three months—because we learned that I was going to high school maybe ... it was around July ... end of June, beginning of July, and I had to start in September—so she didn’t have much time to get the minerval together and buy me a school uniform and other things. So she said to me—well, obviously on her husband’s side, her husband’s family, there was no way, there was no one there she could ask for help. So she was all alone, with almost nothing. She didn’t expect that ... and she also didn’t know what it cost to send a child to high school. So she told me, “We\\'re going to the market.” We went to the market every Wednesday and Saturday, the local markets, and we would sell produce: sweet potatoes, cassava, beans. One week before school started I had finally raised the minerval but it was not enough, not even to buy a suitcase. I remember I took an old suitcase that my father had brought back from Uganda, the only valuable thing [smiles] that I could use. So I took my father\\'s suitcase and I went to school, and when I got back for the Easter holidays ... —pardon me, for Christmas—my father was home. So maybe sometime in October my mother had sent someone—because there were travellers, seasonal workers who went regularly to Uganda—and I think she had sent a message for my father through someone, saying, “If you ever find out where my husband is, tell him to come back home because I need him.” So when I came back for the Christmas break, my father had come home and my mother said that she had scolded him. She had told him, “From now on, you will stay here. We have a child who has succeeded in his studies, it is absolutely necessary that you help me work to pay for his studies.” So my father stayed, obedient [laughs], and they worked hard. When I went back for    Easter break or for the summer vacation, I always went with my parents to the markets, carrying goods on my head, to get some money to pay for my studies. I remember those years well. And I’m glad to be able to say, “Yes, I worked a little bit to pay for my studies”—because, sometimes, we had to walk for almost ten kilometers, with a basket on our heads, to get to one of the markets. It wasn’t close, it was pretty far and it was important not to spend even one franc to buy a Coca-Cola or a Fanta. All the money we made, we brought back home.When we ..., I started high school—my first year in high school was in 1964. That year, there were—in 1963—there was unrest in the south of the country. Tutsis were massacred, I think, in retaliation for the inyenzi attack that came, I believe, from Burundi. The inyenzi was the nickname given to the Tutsi refugees who had left the country, so inyenzi, cockroaches, and they had attacked, but it was suppressed with force. Not only were they fended off—I don’t know if it was with the help of Belgium or Congo—but there was also a retaliation against the Tutsis—their huts were burned, their cows were eaten and people were killed, massacred. So when I arrived at the Groupe Scolaire, the Brothers of Charity at that time felt great animosity towards people who came from Gikongoro—I was from Gikongoro—and there had been many massacres in Gikongoro, particularly in the Cyanika Parish, the parish I was from. So they regarded us as criminals, as murderers. So everyone ... they were saying, “Everyone from Gikongoro,” they were saying, “you, the people from Gikongoro, you are murderers, you are rapists, you are assassins.” So this situation was particularly difficult. It’s true that there were people who came from important Hutu families and who were big activists, but I remember that because of the Brothers\\' reaction to the massacres—especially the killing of students from the school, students who were older than me by a year or two, and who didn’t come back—and those [Hutu] students who were a bit [militant?] were pretending to be nice. Other than that, the relations between Hutu and Tutsi classmates were relatively good. As we were moving from one grade to the next, the number of people from the two ethnicities was balancing itself out. At the beginning, there were a lot more Hutu students, but in fact many Hutus had obtained a place in the school even though they weren’t very bright, they weren’t very smart, and little by little they dropped out, while the Tutsis were often much brighter students. So, as we were going forward in the upper years of high school, there was a balance in the numbers of Hutus and Tutsis.I must say that it ... I have memories from a few years prior to that, three years prior, from 1960, when I saw the burned huts of the Tutsis, when I saw the people that were about to be thrown in the river. These memories were still vivid in my mind and so for me the Brothers’ reaction wasn’t exaggerated. I thought their reaction was perfectly legitimate because there were indeed in my school people who, in my opinion, were there not because they were smart, but simply because they were Hutu and because they were taking the place of the Tutsis who had been killed and who couldn’t come back to school. For a teacher, it must be a terrible thing to see the third, half, or three quarters of your class disappear after the school break, due to the students’ ethnic origin. So I felt it—the fear I had was, rather, that they would say, “But you too are Hutu, you are a criminal,” whereas I wasn’t a criminal, and that, obviously, would have been hurtful. But they were speaking generally, without necessarily, to my knowledge, show animosity towards particular students. They were speaking more generally, and it was like they were telling us, “You, the people from Gikongoro,” and when they would say that, we felt as though they were saying, “you, the Hutu from Gikongoro, we are watching you, be careful.”When I arrived in Belgium, these ethnic issues made me feel extremely uncomfortable. The people who were strongly asserting their Hutu identity were scaring me. It was mostly people from the north, or people from the south who were a bit too militant. Given what I was explaining earlier, coming from a family … where I was like an only child—actually, when I was in high school my parents had other children that I didn’t really get to know because I wasn’t there. So I grew up as an only child, and I was protecting myself, I was being careful. I was paying attention to everything that had to do with these violent games. So, for me, this activism, these demonstrations, I kept a distance from that. When I lived in Belgium, I avoided Rwandans. I didn’t have any Rwandan friends except one of my friends from high school whose family background was more or less similar to mine. So we just kept it to ourselves and avoided these [militant?] small groups that others adhered to. And very quickly, many other students went to the bistros, they were drinking, they would get drunk, they got into fights, etc. ..., or they would go dancing. I always stayed away from them. And I got married very early. I met a fellow student who was Congolese. It had been just two years since I had arrived, maybe a year and a half, and I married her. And it was, of course, a scandal among the Rwandans, to marry a Congolese, because for a Rwandan, the Rwandans are the elite, they are almost like the chosen people. At the time, Rwandans still felt contempt for people from other nations, especially our neighbours, the Burundians and the Congolese. It was as if I had betrayed my compatriots by marrying a foreigner. But curiously, for the Congolese—because my ex—because we are divorced now—she is of ruba origin and the baruba are the proudest Congolese [laughs] who consider themselves Africans above everyone else. So they too were saying, with contempt, “Their daughter is going to marry this little Rwandan.” They almost sabotaged the marriage and the situation was pretty tense. When the Rwandans learned about that they said, “The Congolese want to beat one of our own, we will fight back”—that was the situation, more or less. But after the wedding, I spent more time with the Congolese community. I’ve always liked the Congolese, I’ve always liked their spirit of openness, they don’t take life too seriously—the small groups—in any case, at the time it was like that. They are people who rose above these things. They are also great intellectuals because it was ... at the time I was spending time with people who were great intellectuals and gradually, later on, I think, when I was in Rwanda I lost contact with the Rwandans. I was more in the Congolese community.I was a responsible person, of course, I was a good father, I had two children, I looked after my children well and my studies were going well. Many of my fellow students from the same faculty took many years to graduate and I finished in ..., I was going from one year to the next in my program without a problem. So, as I wasn’t seeing the Rwandans much, it\\'s as if they completely forgot about me and as for the Congolese, they ended up understanding that, yes, I was just a small Rwandan, but a small Rwandan who was respectable, who respected their daughter, who took good care of my children and who worked hard. So the Congolese accepted me and I lived in their community like one of them, really. I felt much more at ease there because there were no ethnic issues. I must say that I was more in the baruba community, which was a very big community, with very proud people. They are really very proud, great workers too who loved working, who were brilliant and who had something to be proud of because they came from a great country, that was a fact.Yes ... of course at the time we communicated by letters, I wrote to them, and like all Rwandans who were not very well-off, I would even say poor, I regularly sent money, from my grant, I sent money to my parents. I was able to go back to Rwanda only once during the holidays to see my parents, in 1975. I went by myself and it was then that I met my young sisters who were still tiny little babies. So I saw that we finally had a family and the neighbours now knew that this child that they had never known was my father’s son. They looked down on my father, hated him, but then began to respect him because they saw that he had a child who had gone far away, abroad. So people were looking at me, I would even say with some sort of fear. It was really respect mixed with fear because they knew—all that they’ve made my parents go through, all the discrimination that my parents had to endure, the rejection, the contempt and now they saw that my parents had a child who might later have a good future. But I would say that it was too late to invest in this relationship with the neighbours. It was too late, on both my father\\'s side and on my mother\\'s side, because I hadn’t forgotten that my mother\\'s family had refused to help us, and I thought, “I don’t have a relationship, I don’t have a connection with that family, I’ve got nothing to do with them.” So since I left in 1964, I didn’t set foot again in the place where I grew up, at my mother’s family, until very recently, actually, last year, after 45 years. So I cut them off—and on my father\\'s side too—the people who had persecuted my parents so much that I never wanted to have a relationship with them. So I was like an only child with no attachment, neither on my mother’s side, nor on my father’s, which is something very rare in African cultures, and in Rwandan culture particularly, not to have attachment on either side of the family.No, after my studies in Belgium the circumstances were such that I went back to Rwanda. One of my cousins \\u200b\\u200bwas rector of the university. And another set of circumstances—the National University of Rwanda was, as you know, founded by Canadians, by Father George-Henri Levesque, and there were many Canadians who taught in the different faculties there at the time. But in the year when I returned, Canada had decided to gradually withdraw from the various faculties and had started by withdrawing from the faculty of economics and the social sciences. In this faculty there was a teaching position open in psychology and it was the first position that was rwandanized—this was part of the process of rwandanization of the workplace. So the Canadian psychologist who worked there had left and the position was vacant. And when I arrived my cousin, who was the rector of the university, told me, “There’s an open position for a professor of psychology and you can fill it”—because there was no other psychologist at that time. I was one of the first psychologists in the country. So, again, by a set of circumstances I became professor, I would say, without having to go through too many steps. The position was open and I was the only person who could fill it.So, given my attitude—I was very critical and I didn’t want to play the same game as other professors who were really pandering to the regime. The President’s brother was teaching at the Faculty of Medicine and I still remember that many of my colleagues [indistinct] to get on his good side, and every time I saw him when we went out for a beer, I used the opportunity to criticize him and denounce his brother’s policies. I was behaving like an academic should, like what I was used to doing in Belgium and I think that in a way, I was telling him: “Listen, Séraphin … when you consider … you are an academic, when you consider everything that’s happening in this country and there are journalists and people who write about our country—you have to give good advice to your brother.” Some things are unacceptable. For example, when professors in a university like this one can go as far as be afraid even of a driver[?], be afraid of their students, it’s shameful.” And I think that because I was saying out loud what I was thinking, people were looking at me as a sort of a court jester. That guy wasn’t stupid. And I think maybe he understood that it was better to know the truth directly instead of receiving false praise. I was never scared of Séraphin. Especially since I said to myself that I have nothing to lose, after all. I didn’t have any material possessions, I didn’t have properties, I had absolutely nothing. I only had my job, which I liked, and that was all. But at the same time, I knew that I couldn’t really hope to obtain a grant. Still, in 1980, in the early 1980s, the Canadian delegation arrived to select the fellows. They were awarding grants. Most of us, professors, we had master\\'s degrees, but not doctorates, and after teaching for two-three years, we could get a grant to come to Canada. I wasn’t eligible because I was in the social sciences. Those who were eligible for a doctorate were in science, agricultural science, in the faculty of biology, but I was in the social sciences. It was no longer a priority for Canada and that\\'s why my position was the first one to be rwandanized. But I had a very good relationship with my Canadian colleagues with whom I spent more of my free time than with my Rwandan colleagues. At Hotel Ibis or Hotel Faucon, where people usually went for drinks, I was there more often with my Canadian friends, my Canadian colleagues than with other Rwandans, because Rwandans always talked about politics and I couldn’t control what I was saying, because I was too critical of the regime. So I was thinking that it’s better to avoid socializing with Rwandans. I was much more at ease expressing my views in the company of Canadians. So the Canadian delegation was there to select fellows and then the dean of my faculty, who was a good friend of mine, asked the members of the delegation  if he could still put my name on the list of people to consider. They said, “Look, he\\'s not in science—we\\'ll place him on the list, but his application is not a priority.” So it was like telling me not to get my hopes up, I won’t get the grant. So it was around the time of the holidays, in 1980, and we were supposed to have left, the fellows were supposed to have left in September to come to Canada. When the holidays came, I said to my wife and children, “We are going to Kinshasa. We’ll go on vacation to visit the grandparents because if I ever have a chance to go to Canada, we won’t be able to come back because it’s too far. I wouldn’t have enough money to pay for the plane ticket for [inaudible, scrambled recording] ..., little children.” All the other fellows, grant candidates, said to me: “Are you mad? If ever you have a slight chance to get the grant you have to stay here so that they can process your application. You have to go to the ministry, you have to go to your administrative district, you have to be there to move your file forward.” But I was thinking that the best way to take care of my file is actually to stay away, so that they don’t think of me, that they don’t know that my name is on the list. So I did it on purpose. I thought that if I had a slight chance to go to Canada, the intelligence service agents shouldn’t be aware that my name was on the list. So I left for Kinshasa with my wife and children [inaudible, scrambled recording] and by mid-August, I went to the Canadian embassy in Kinshasa to pay a courtesy call to the ambassador. One of my former colleagues was already working there, and when the ambassador learned that a professor from the NUR [the National University of Rwanda] was there, he asked me to go into his office and said: “Listen, [inaudible, scrambled recording] ... and it\\'s too late to send via diplomatic bag. Could you bring on my behalf to the minister of education the envelope that I\\'m going to give you?” I said: “Yes, no problem.” So that\\'s how I ended up carrying the diplomatic bag [laughs]. I don’t think these kinds of things would be done now, but in the 1980s a lot of things were done this way. I asked the ambassador: “Can you tell me the names of the grant recipients?” Yes, he read the list of people and all my colleagues’ names were on it and by chance my name was also on the list. So I was really happy, I brought the envelope, I asked for a meeting with the minister of education [inaudible, scrambled recording] ..., “I bring diplomatic mail for the minister and the ambassador asked me to hand it to him in person, not to his secretary, not to anyone else, but to the minister himself. If he\\'s not there, I\\'ll come back.” So finally they said I could see the minister, he was there [inaudible, scrambled recording] and I said, “Mr. Minister I was just in Kinshasa, I have the list of fellows going to Canada and the ambassador showed me that my name is also on the list. So to avoid too many complicated steps, I normally have to come here and ask your permission [inaudible, scrambled recording].” He couldn’t refuse. He gave me the papers and right away I went to the administrative district, they immediately filled out the papers for me, then I went to immigration and handed them the documents. Of course, the people who worked there were my former students, [inaudible, scrambled recording]. I said, “I know you.” He said, “Yes, I was your student.” “Oh, you work here now?” “Yes, you failed me.” [laughs]. So I thought, “Forget it, I have no chance.” Finally, two weeks later I had the passport, I never understood [laughs] what happened. I jumped on the plane and I came here.Absolutely. By the way, two of my colleagues who had stayed in Rwanda to process their files, unfortunately were not able to come. They were too conspicuous by their presence. I think that\\'s the reason why.Oh, it went very well. I think what made it easy was my experience in Belgium and the fact that I had traveled a lot before. I arrived at the airport [inaudible, scrambled recording], I looked at the list of housing for rent, and there were weekly rentals. I phoned one apartment [inaudible, scrambled recording] right away and then [after renting the apartment] I went next door to Provigo, I bought groceries and that night we had dinner at home. I didn’t spend a single night at a hotel and the following week I took the time to look for a less expensive apartment and a week later I was at the university, at UQAM, where I started my PhD. I adapted very quickly, without any problems.It was a very difficult time, but at the same time I’ve always been very lucky in my life. Maybe I was born under a lucky star. One of my old friends, a colleague from the National University of Rwanda, we came to Canada at the same time, and he was program director at the Université de Montréal. We had taught together in Rwanda, and at one point he was recruiting lecturers, he knew the courses I had taught and that I had the skills for that, so he hired me as a lecturer at the Université de Montréal barely three months after my arrival. So I started teaching as a lecturer at the Université de Montréal. Also, I was invited to CIDA’s pre-departure sessions in Ottawa. When Canadian aid workers were about to leave for Africa, they received training in preparation for their travel, to get to know the country, to get to know the customs, etc. So CIDA would call in resource persons [to brief the aid workers]. There weren’t too many of us at the time, resource people from Africa, and in those years there were still a lot of aid workers going to Rwanda. So they phoned the university and learned that there was a Rwandan working there. They were looking for a resource person for the aid workers going to Rwanda and I got a small contract to go and talk to people. There was no special preparation. I was to talk to them about the political system, the social, religious, educational systems, and so on. But the person who ran the program at CIDA at that time saw that I had good knowledge, that I had a lot of experience and he offered me to be not the resource person briefing the aid workers, but to give pre-departure training workshops. There already was a small team of resource persons who were giving workshops for people going abroad. So because of my background in psychology and in anthropology, I was hired as a resource person at that time at CIDA. So I started working at CIDA. I had at least one contract a month because there were regular pre-departure sessions for aid workers who were leaving; so once a month I had at least one pre-departure session, and it was very well paid. Later, when my grant got cut for political reasons, the one day that I was working at CIDA was enough to pay for my rent and food—modestly, but I never had the slightest problem paying my rent or buying food. Because of a single day of work—I did my job well, I was well-respected, I had very good evaluations, so I kept this job for years.Because I was very critical, at one point I think it got to be a little too much. One day, the embassy summoned us to Ottawa because they intended to form units. A unit ... like the units in Rwanda, political units, here in Canada as well. So we were called to Ottawa, all the students—an important meeting to which all the students were obliged to go because if you didn’t go—and since it’s basically the Rwandan government that pays your grant—actually, it’s not the Rwandan government that pays your grant, but that negotiated your grant—it was very frowned upon. So I went. I didn’t really know what it was going to be and the ambassador told us that we were going to form units, political units here, a unit of the [inaudible, scrambled recording] and that’s why they had summoned us, so [inaudible, scrambled recording], and so on. And I said, “No, it’s out of the question. It’s an aberration.” And I firmly opposed that during the meeting. I gave my reasons, I said, “Look, we already have too many problems, there already is too much tension between us Rwandans. We don’t talk about it here[?]. But at the same time, we are lucky to be abroad and for once to be able to say what we want. And some of us are in political science, others are in psychology, sociology, in disciplines where we are being asked to speak up our mind, to say what we think and now you’re making up these units that will [inaudible, scrambled recording].” In any case, I said, “I personally am completely against this and I think it\\'s stupefying, I think that it shouldn’t be imposed on students studying abroad. Those who want to, when they go back to Rwanda, are free to join the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (NRMDD), to wear the movement’s uniforms and so on, to wear the little medals that they were already distributing, but here I think it’s not doing any service to the students.” And what happened then was people were afraid to approach me during the dinner we were later served—I don’t remember in which hotel—nobody dared come close to me. People avoided me. It was as though they were saying, “That guy is dangerous, he\\'s crazy. If they see us next to him, they’ll think we share the same views and the same ideas as him.” As it happens, when the minister of education visited six months later, I learned that my grant had been cut. Why? The ambassador explained that it was because of my pride. When you say … when you say of a Rwandan that he is proud, it really means that he is insolent, ungrateful, someone who is contemptuous—that sort of thing. So the minister told me that there were bad reports against me, that I was someone who had an evil spirit, that I was a bad citizen, that I was ungrateful to the country that had given me the chance to come here and that, as a consequence, they were ending my grant. And I said to the minister: \"Look, yes, you awarded me the grant, I\\'m the one who goes to the library, I work, I study and what I said at the embassy, \\u200b\\u200bI was expressing my thoughts.” The minister—whom I knew well because he was a former friend from my university years in Belgium, we knew each other there too—I said, “Look,”—his name was Charles—I said, “Charles, I\\'m sorry, but do your homework and I’ll do mine. You can end my grant”—it didn’t matter much to me. In fact, it suited me that they would cut the grant. Why did it suit me? Because at that point, I was divorced and my wife had already been granted refugee status here with the children. She had obtained this status while I was in Rwanda doing fieldwork. So when I came back to Canada, I learned that I was separated, that my children already had a special status, and as a former CIDA fellow, I had to go back home after graduation. But as my scholarship had been cut, I considered that I no longer had ties to Rwanda. The country had reneged on me, I had been blacklisted and therefore I had nothing to do with the country anymore. So I stayed here, almost in a limbo. Luckily, I was teaching at the Université de Montréal and afterwards at UQAM because I was a good teacher and I had mastered the subject and I had good evaluations from CIDA. So CIDA ends my grant, but at the same time I get hired at another department at CIDA [laughs]. Luckily, these departments do not communicate well with each other. So finally I was able to continue working like this until I submitted my thesis, and I got a job almost immediately after I submitted it.Yes, I didn’t have a choice because the situation—as it often happens when people divorce—the relationship with my ex was very tense, the communication was really bad. She obtained a refugee status at the time when I was outside of the country and, in fact, I don’t know what she had said about me at the immigration office. When I left for Rwanda my file at the immigration office was small like this [shows “small” with his hands] and when I came back my file was like this [shows “big”]. Every time I went to the immigration office and they saw my name, they would send me back. They were waiting for me to submit my thesis so that they could kick me out of Canada. When I understood that, I said, “Well, I won’t submit the thesis.” So I dragged it on. The problem was that ... to renew my student status it was necessary to prove every year that I had enough money to live for a year, to be able to extend the contract. And because of this little job I had with CIDA, I had managed to save money, to put a certain amount of money in my account, and regularly made deposits at the bank, and I showed to immigration the photocopy proving that I have money in the bank. So they had no choice but to renew my visa. So I started the immigration process. At the time we had to—and I think that even now it\\'s still the same—you had to apply for an immigrant status from outside of Canada. So I went to New York. The file was not moving forward. Every time I inquired, I was told there was some kind of a problem in Montreal. And when I came back to Montreal, nobody at the immigration office wanted to look at me. I was really discouraged and I felt really depressed. I didn’t understand what was happening. Then, by chance, one of my former Canadian colleagues from the National University of Rwanda, to whom I told my troubles, told me that one of his friends worked in the immigration office. He gave me a little note and I went to see this person at the Quebec immigration office. The person received me well and gave me a little note and said: “Go to the Quebec consulate in New York, to the Quebec delegation in New York, you will see the person in charge with this note, we will try to unblock your file.” I went there, and then everything got resolved just like that, in less than a year I finally got the famous documents [smiles] of a landed immigrant. And when I got them—I remember, it was December 17th when I went to get the papers in New York—I got the status. When I arrived there I wrote the conclusion of my thesis and I submitted it. At last I was safe.Yes, at that time they wanted to hire me at CIDA since I had a long ... a lot of experience, so they actually wanted to hire me [inaudible, scrambled recording], but the job ... even though I loved the work, but I could just see myself becoming a civil servant and doing things that didn’t correspond to what I had ... I thought, “Well, I didn’t do a PhD just to become a civil servant, to manage development projects when that\\'s not my expertise.” And I hesitated. And they insisted, they said, “You have to sign the contract so we can hire you,” and I said: “Give me three more weeks.” They did and I used that time to think. Three weeks passed: “Will you sign or not?” I said, “Give me three more weeks,” and they gave me three more weeks. So finally they understood that I wasn’t interested. Why did I do that? Because I had seen a job posting for a teaching position in my field at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières. So I said, “I\\'ll try my luck.” I was really naïve. I thought that seeing a newspaper ad for a job and applying for it, that I would ... that I would be hired. I hung on to that thought and while my application was reviewed in Trois-Rivières, the people at CIDA were becoming impatient and didn’t want to wait any longer. They said, “Look, it’s clear that you don’t want this position so we’ll give it to someone else.” I said, “Okay, give it to someone else.” So I clung to that slight chance that maybe I will get the job in Trois-Rivières. So finally, I was called for an interview in Trois-Rivières. In the 1980s, the universities were not hiring. They weren’t recruiting much and I learned that 15 candidates had applied for that position. What happened was that I got the job [surprised look]. The salary was half of what I would have received at CIDA. I knew that because I had seen the work contract for the position. But I was so happy to finally be able to say that I’m working in my field and also because earning a lot of money as a civil servant, but doing a job I didn’t like—no, I wouldn’t have been happy with that at all. I knew a lot of government workers, many friends at CIDA with whom I went for a beer and with whom we chatted, and many of them had a very complicated personal life. They had serious personal problems and I didn’t want that to happen to me too. I really wanted to have a career that I like. I’ve always liked teaching and research, so I was very happy. To me, to be welcomed in Trois-Rivières was like a blessing.I am available to help, that’s for sure. In fact, on many occasions, when people were going through a tough time, I was available to help, to encourage them to get through those difficult times, help them get through this process and, especially, to tell them, “Don’t be discouraged.” One thing I always tell immigrants is: “We decide to immigrate for a reason. We leave behind much more difficult conditions of living and when we arrive here, it’s not always easy either. But even if it’s difficult, I always say, think about your children. Think about the next generation.” The first generation is the one that has to make sacrifices in the name of the generations to come. All the better if in some cases, as in my case, exceptionally, you can be lucky and get a job in your field of work, but I tell people, “Don’t expect that you will necessarily work in your field. That can be difficult. And even if it doesn’t happen, if you don’t get a job in your field of work, don’t despair, think about your children, because if you help them, if you are strong, if you don’t get discouraged, your children will have a much better chance to find what is good for them.” That’s really my message. I know, there are people who are doctors, engineers and here they have to work in a convenience store or as taxi drivers, but the important thing is to say to yourself, “I’m doing this for my children. At least I live in a free country”—because you can live in your country and … A lot of research was done in the early 1990s with teenagers from different countries, and I remember one of the interviews we did was with a gentleman who was … who used to be university president. At an university in the Middle East. He was university president and what was his job here? He worked in a convenience store. But he had remained the same gentleman, the same individual. The fact that he was working in a convenience store wasn’t the problem. He said, “I live in a free world and I work for my children. I earn my living honorably.” He recounted the life he’d had in his country, as university president—it was horrible, to always have to bow down to the police, to the secret service and to know that at any moment all kinds of problems can befall you. And now he was living in a free world and I think it\\'s the same thing ... My hope, of course, is that the host society will make an effort to really integrate immigrants because, on the one hand, many immigrants are accepted here, thousands every year, but on the other hand, we don’t really make a big effort to integrate them, whereas immigrants are among the most educated people in Quebec. That\\'s a shame, I think, it truly is unfortunate, because many resources are left unused in this way.I was really touched, I was surprised by their welcome. I thought that people will feel insulted and that people will feel angry, but at the same time I thought to myself—once I made the decision to come, I said to myself: “Yes, there may be some Tutsis who would feel angry to see a Hutu there and this at least would allow them to express their anger towards a Hutu who’s there, to let them get those feelings out because that would make them feel good. I know that I haven’t—not only have I not committed a crime, but I didn’t support—I wasn’t an accomplice. But if my presence allows someone to let go of their anger and that I am, at least, a scapegoat, that would be a good thing. Even if they insult me, even if they pour beer on me, even if they point a finger at me as a genocide perpetrator, what is my suffering, my humiliation compared to what they have gone through? That\\'s what I always think. I always think, “Wherever I am, if a Tutsi begins insulting Hutus, even if at some point I feel angry, if I feel annoyed, whatever feeling I have—shame, fear, tension—it’s nothing compared to what people have experienced. It’s nothing compared to the wound that they live with. Since then, not only did I go to the commemoration, but a year later, a few Rwandans came here from Rwanda for the conference and I met them and they said: “Emmanuel, it would be good if you come to Rwanda.” Because after I left Rwanda in 1980, I only went back there to do fieldwork, because CIDA required us to go back to Rwanda and do work on the ground, and I was afraid that I would be held there, that I wasn’t going to come back. And when, luckily, I came back here, I said, “That’s it. I have nothing to do with Rwanda, it’s over.” I didn’t return there during the whole time of Habyarimana’s rule. Then the genocide happened and I didn’t go back to Rwanda. So, in 1985, I returned to Rwanda for the first time after 25 years. After 23 years, let\\'s say, because the last time I was there was in 1983–1984, so for 22–23 years I had not set foot in Rwanda.The first time I went back to Rwanda was in 1985. I attended a conference there. I didn’t go to the country’s interior. But I did go to Butare, where I grew up and where I taught. Of course, I visited the Kigali Memorial. I think when we go back to Rwanda, when we visit this memorial, it\\'s a truly moving place. Especially when you go to the section dedicated to children. I had shivers when I was there, I flinched, I cried, I became almost inconsolable. Once again I was thinking, “It’s not possible.” No one can understand how things like that can happen—neighbours who kill their neighbours, things like that. Remembering the images from Gikongoro when I was young in 1960—so from the village where I grew up at my grandmother\\'s—I wanted to go back to Gikongoro, especially when I learned that the biggest memorial, the most harrowing in Rwanda is in Gikongoro, in Murambi. So in my imagination, in my memories, I thought that there certainly are people in this Murambi memorial that I knew and they were killed by people I also knew, people from Gikongoro. And not only people I knew, but maybe even members of my family, particularly on my mother\\'s side. So to go back to Gikongoro, where I went to elementary school, I didn’t want to set foot there. I really didn’t want to go back to that place. Last year, I went to Rwanda for my sabbatical year and my friend Callixte was there too and I accompanied him to his home in Kibeho. Then ... he was going to show me his home for the first time and I remember asking him ...: “Callixte where was your house? Where was your parents\\' house?” He said, “I think it was here” ... because he had [shows “a house” with his hands], the sorghum has grown, it was all fields now. And then at one point he said: “Oh no, it wasn’t here. No, actually, it\\'s there [points to a place]. It’s over there.” And I said, “Callixte, how do you feel coming here, to the place where your parents were killed?”—because we went to the Kibeho memorial where his parents had been killed. And I said, “Where do you get the courage to come here?” He said, “It’s important to come, because I grew up here and the people who killed us, who killed our people must see that we are survivors and that we are still alive. That’s why I’m back here.” Actually, when we were leaving his house, we met a man who was suspected of having killed many people on his hill. That\\'s when I told Callixte that I don’t have the courage to go back to the place where I grew up, and which I left in 1964, because of my memories as a little boy, in 1964, when I saw the people who were going to be thrown in the Rukarara River, and the memory of that aunt who was hugging her friend—the image had stayed in my mind like a photograph. And Callixte said to me, “Maybe you should go back there. You should go back because you grew up there.” [sighs] I summoned up my courage and I went there with my daughter. My daughter was born in Belgium and this was her first visit to Rwanda after 30 years. And so she saw the neighbourhood where we lived in Butare and she had never been there before, to this place where I grew up. She had visited my parents\\' house, where my parents lived, but not this place where I went to primary school. So I went there with my family. It was like a pilgrimage. I thought to myself, “Who am I going to meet in this place and, especially, what have they done?” Because my fear was: I will meet people who may have killed others and they will hug me. I will shake hands with people who have also held machetes, who have severed the head of a child or the head of a woman, and I will hug those people. To me, going to this place ... I forbade myself to go there, I said “I can’t go.” So, I summoned up my courage and I arrived on this hill and I saw an old man working in his field. I recognized him: one of my cousins. I greeted him. Of course, I didn’t say who I was, no one could know who I was—it had been 45 years since the last time I had set foot there. But he had heard that I had come, and he guessed it: “Is that you, Emmanuel?” I said, “Yes, it’s Emmanuel.” His name is Antoine. I said, “Yes, Antoine, it’s me, Emmanuel.” He came closer, we hugged, we greeted each other, I introduced him to my daughter. So I saw the place where I had grown up, and, of course, I was curious to know what he had done during the genocide. How he had behaved. This was for sure the burning question on my mind. I absolutely had to ask him. So I asked him the question. I said, “Can you tell me what happened during the genocide?” He is now 80 years old. He said, “Listen, me ... one of my children was sick, the people ran away, the neighbours left but I stayed here, quietly. My child was sick, I am a widower, my wife had died, and I didn’t want to go abroad. I didn’t kill anyone, I didn’t steal anybody’s cows. I am comfortable in my property here, that you see, I had nothing to fear—why go abroad? Why run away when I wasn’t guilty? I stayed here.” It was really like a weight lifted off my shoulders to see that [wipes tears from his eyes] ... I get emotional when I speak about this man who for me truly is a righteous man. I was deeply moved seeing him and it was like a confirmation that there are still righteous people in this world. He’s a righteous man; there are also survivors among the righteous. Those were the thoughts that were going through my mind. I was so happy to hear that, to see that this man, who is 80 years old, he stayed there, he didn’t move, he didn’t kill, he protected his family. So he told me that the RPF soldiers came, at some point everyone had fled but him. So they wanted to know why he hadn’t run away. He told them, “I didn’t run because I haven’t killed anyone.” “Do you have money?” He said, “Yes, I have money.” He had a lot of money. He said, “I have cows, I have a property, I sell things at the market.” Finally, they let him go, they left. And I was happy to see this righteous man there.Yes, and then I went to my elementary school and ran into one of my old classmates who now teaches there. With his class of children and with my daughter—we took a lot of pictures of the children. I couldn’t talk to him, though. Of course, I didn’t want to come off as an investigator, asking people what such and such person had done, and so on. I was happy to see the little children who were there. The future, the young children, innocent smiles. And my daughter was so happy to see where her father went to school, and we took a lot of pictures. In fact, I made them into a photo album and then a calendar, which I sent to my friend the teacher so he could put it up in the classroom. A calendar with the pictures of his class of children, thinking that it is good for the kids to see that someone who has studied well, who has sat on the same school benches as them, someone from this little village, has been able to go far in his life. It could be inspiring for some to see that I had come back with my daughter. I’m sure that this will inspire one or two of them to dream that one day they can go even farther, they can accomplish things, leave that place or stay there and help develop the country further, saying, “There is one man who is from here and he went far in his life, and he didn’t forget about us, and he came back to see us.” I was really happy to be there. Another person who made my return a happy one was a cousin of mine. We grew up together as little children and she was very protective of me. She is an extremely kind woman and I remember, in 1960 precisely, when the killings were happening, when they were killing the Tutsis’ cows and eating the Tutsis’ cows, she told me: “If anyone offers you meat, don’t take it. It’s devil’s meat. These people are criminals. You have to pray and guard your spirit against corruption.” This woman overprotected me. She was extraordinarily kind. So, she told me that during the genocide, she had hidden a little child whose parents had just been killed. The child was playing with my cousin’s children and at night they went to pick up the child and they hid the child in her home. Then at some point ... because the neighbours were sending other children to investigate if there weren’t any more children hidden there—you’ve got to be pretty depraved to send a child, because you know that an adult will hide the truth—so the neighbours were sending young children saying, “The kids like to play 02: 22: 15 together. Go check if there’re any children hidden there.” But my cousin is smart and she had told her own children: “We shouldn’t say that we are hiding a child here because they’re sending their children baje gutata”—that’s the expression she used: “they come here to spy”—“we mustn’t tell them that we’ve hidden a child here.” So they kept this child safe until the end of the genocide. My cousin remained true to herself. Her name is Marguerite. She is a truly wonderful woman.It was a shock. But at the same time I could see the physical reconstruction of the country. Geographically, Rwanda is really a beautiful country. That’s when I remembered ... I began this interview by saying that Canadians or Europeans would say that Rwanda was a beautiful country and I didn’t see its beauty. Now, after having seen other countries in Africa, after having travelled, it\\'s true that it\\'s a beautiful country.Some efforts are made towards a psychological reconstruction too. I think that something ... as a psychologist ... and I talk about it during my conference presentations—when I meet colleagues, psychiatrists, I tell them that there are things we don’t know on the level of psychological reconstruction of individuals. Why? Because the genocide of the Tutsis is a trauma for every Rwandan Hutu, Tutsi, Twa, the expatriates who were there, anyone who was in Rwanda at the time, it’s a trauma in the sense that we define trauma. It’s a trauma that can lead to what is called “post-traumatic stress disorder”: witnessing extraordinary atrocities. So seeing someone being killed, stepping over dead bodies in the streets, roadblocks, and so on—whatever your ethnicity, this is a traumatic situation. One million people died in three months. And we’re not talking about the wounded, we’re not talking about the people who were raped, we’re not talking about the other millions of people who were deeply traumatized. So travelling around this country and seeing people who don’t ... yes, there are people who have had serious psychological traumas, dissociative states, psychotic states, depression, or syndromes of post-traumatic stress, but we would expect this to be the case for almost all Rwandans. I would have expected that at least five million Rwandans fell into depression and almost seven million fell into major depression and experienced post-traumatic stress. And what do we see? People are still standing. Yes, some might say: “It was very hard for so and so, he doesn’t seem to be able to pull through, it’s very difficult,” but the majority of people are standing on their two feet. No doubt, on the inside, many of them feel distressed, but they are standing on their two feet. They are standing without being helped by psychologists. Last year I was again in Rwanda—there are now many psychiatrists there. Last year there were three. Now, after the genocide, there are about a 100-150 psychologists in the whole country. The three psychiatrists are in Kigali; two of them work full-time, the third works part-time. And most of the psychologists are in Kigali and work for NGOs. It must be said that most of the people who have experienced these deeply traumatic events have not received counselling help in the sense that we understand that here. In any case, they haven’t received help from specialists. And they have still managed to pull through—how can we explain that? That, to me, as a Rwandan psychologist, remains an unknown.Absolutely. I\\'m shocked when I see people ... when they talk about the genocide and what is of interest to them is depression and post-traumatic stress. And I say to them: “What should be of interest to us is, rather, the question of how people who have been through such horrendous events can continue to function.” Including the Rwandan Tutsi survivors who are here in Montreal. I’ve talked to many of them about this. I said, “Have you gone to see a psychiatrist? Have you done a psychotherapy treatment?” Many have not; they haven’t seen psychiatrists, they haven’t seen psychologists and they are able to fulfill their family and professional and social responsibilities. It’s surprising that someone who has experienced such terrible things ... and we’re talking about not only witnessing them, we’re talking about people who have lost their entire families, relatives and who have been traumatized, who have lived in appalling conditions for months and months. As a psychologist, I—really, no psychiatrist nor psychologist could write about it because when the Holocaust happened [inaudible] and they started working on the Holocaust [inaudible] years after that. There was the Cambodian genocide, which has been completely suppressed; the trials of the former Cambodians are just beginning. There hasn’t been much research on this. In fact, it’s the Rwandan genocide, really, that has generated scholarly interest, but we still have a lot to learn from the Rwandans. To understand what happened and where they get this strength from. That people have experienced post-traumatic stress, in the sense that we understand it—for some, that’s indeed the case. But it’s surprising to see how many people have pulled through. And … well, there are many terms we use: resilience, post-traumatic awareness. I think that at one point we have to put the theories aside, work closely with the Rwandans and ask them to talk to us, so that they can enrich our theories. Because the danger is starting work, starting research with a questionnaire that we have developed, a questionnaire on post-traumatic stress, developed on the basis of the experiences of people who have been in car accidents, American soldiers who have fought in the Vietnam war or who have come back from Iraq and who have seen psychiatrists, psychologists and who have flashbacks, and so on, and we have created a questionnaire based on that and we want to apply the same questionnaire to Rwandans. Or a bus driver who’s been in an accident or a taxi driver who’s been in an accident and who have seen blood and other things, and who have experienced trauma, etc....—but we can’t compare that to the genocide. The Rwandans have lived through something different. That\\'s what I’m interested in, that\\'s what I\\'m trying to understand and I would humbly say that I still can’t understand it.I feel … I still feel sadness, loneliness when I think that this abominable crime, this genocide committed by hundreds of thousands of Rwandans—that there isn’t a movement on the part of the Hutus to ask forgiveness. That there aren’t any Hutus able to do a symbolic gesture of reparation like that. I don’t think it’s enough just to ask forgiveness with speeches, with petitions—there must also be reparations. But to me the reparation will be symbolic. The survivors who have lost their parents, the men who have lost their wives, the women who have lost their husbands, the people who have lost their brothers and sisters—nothing can restore those losses. The reparation will always be symbolic. But there must be reparation. We shouldn’t only ask forgiveness. Everyone can make amends according to their means. So the question you\\'re asking me—it really is a feeling of loneliness because when I visit Rwanda, I see there signs of physical rebuilding. The people are doing everything they can to live together, Hutus and Tutsis. But people continue to act as if nothing has happened. As if …, once again, this denial that I saw when I was in high school when we knew that there were Tutsi students, that their houses had been burned, their parents had been killed or injured, or some had their parents leave as refugees abroad and they remained in Rwanda to be brought up by an uncle or an aunt, but we knew that their parents were abroad—we said absolutely nothing about that and my impression is that the same thing is happening in Rwanda now. The price we are asking from Rwandans, from the Rwandan Tutsis, those who were in Rwanda, the price we are asking them to pay—the reconciliation, the reconstruction—it’s enormous. In my opinion, it rests on the shoulders of Tutsi survivors. It\\'s like asking them to close their eyes, to forget. And to remember during moments of commemoration only. I, as Hutu—yes, I now accept this identity that I didn’t accept until I was 50 years old. I didn’t care being Hutu, but from the age of 50 I was forced to recognize that, yes, my ancestors were Hutu. I have to live with this Hutu identity. And to me, this Hutu identity is really shameful. I\\'m not personally ashamed, but I feel shame for the Hutus and that makes me feel so ... not pain, but ... I don’t know how to name it. I think that even if it\\'s humiliating ... for sure this humiliation ... than asking forgiveness. But what is that humiliation compared to the people who have lost everything? What difference does it make recognizing that my people have committed a crime and that I’m asking forgiveness on their behalf? In this act of humility, I’m asking forgiveness on behalf of those who don’t want to ask forgiveness. To show humility, to kneel, to beg for forgiveness from a survivor. This gesture of showing humility is considered a form of humiliation by many Hutus who don’t want to ask forgiveness. But they must always consider that this humiliation is nothing compared to someone who has lost everything, who is like a tree in a bushfire, a tree that stands alone, everything has burned around it and it starts to grow a few branches—some of the survivors remind me of such a burnt tree—a bushfire that completely destroys everything and this one tree whose branches are burned and, little by little, starts growing a small leaf and then a branch, and it starts coming to life again, although the burns are still visible. And next to it, the Hutus are like the nearby forest—thriving, green, with its branches, its trees, rich with game, and they are there. The future of this country ... fortunately, there are young people, but it’s a pity that the Hutu adults who were in Rwanda and who are still there, continue to live by this kind of thinking: “We’ll get older and then we’ll be buried and forgotten, and as the years pass, all of what happened will be buried.” So they start new businesses and continue to act as if nothing has happened. That\\'s what really makes me sad.Yes, it hurts ... we often ask this question and we see during the vigils ... and there are survivors who don’t want to come to the commemorative vigils because it hurts to remember ... it\\'s not only at that moment that one thinks of the loved ones lost, but many feel distraught during these emotional moments. Some people even say, “Is it worth it to continue doing these events? Shouldn’t we stop that, it seriously affects people?” Some people don’t even want to attend, including some survivors—but I think it\\'s important. It’s important to attend the commemorations. History should not be buried. If we are to say “this must not happen again,” we can only prevent it from happening if we have the courage to face these horrific scenes and to talk about them to our children and to strangers. For me, a Hutu, to be able to tell that to other Hutus, to be able to tell it to strangers and to tell it to the Tutsis I meet, and who might say, “Should we listen to this Hutu? Is he sincere or is it simply indyarya, a hypocrisy?” I wouldn’t be hurt if people think that. I would understand completely and definitely wouldn’t be angry at a Tutsi who says, “We don’t trust this Hutu who pretends to distance himself from those of his fellow Hutus who are rejecting us and who don’t want to do the honorable thing and apologize.” It’s quite understandable that one can be wary of all Hutus because, at present, the Hutu people—when I was in Rwanda and everywhere I go—I ask the question “Is there currently a movement organized by Hutus with the intent to ask forgiveness? Would there be Hutus who...” I was giving a presentation last year, last December, I was invited to a forum organized by the first lady. After my presentation someone asked me a question—at some point after I finished my presentation—and the question was how do I feel being a Hutu. How do I see the future of the country? And I said that when I go back to Rwanda my hope is to find several Hutus—two, three, five individuals—with whom we can sit down together and see how we can start the work of repair, symbolically of course. As I was saying, the work of repair here can only be symbolic because we can’t bring back the dead. We can’t forget the horrors that took place, but at the same time what happened has happened—the tragedy that the Tutsis have experienced, the appalling act of genocide. But life goes on. We must rebuild the country. But to rebuild the country there must be people who are able to say: “We have done horrible things.” Even if one didn’t personally participate, to be able to say that there is a guiding ideology. And that ideology was collectively fueled by the people of our ethnic group with the intention to eliminate another ethnic group. We have to be able to denounce that because currently there are still deniers. I can tell you, I hesitated going to Rwanda after the genocide and I went because I was invited, mainly by my Tutsi friends. I didn’t want to go because I didn’t want to go places and be seen by a Hutu who comes up to me and hugs me and starts telling me about how miserable things are and how tragic things are for the Hutus in Rwanda today, and, unfortunately, that’s how I felt on two or three occasions during my trip to Rwanda. The people I knew ... especially two women I knew in the 1980s before I left—knowing that I am Hutu, they felt comfortable talking to me about their misery, because currently they say that the power belongs to the Tutsi and that the Hutus are left behind. And who else can a Hutu confidently say this if not to another Hutu? Witnessing the plight of these people, who at the same time say absolutely nothing about the genocide, who say absolutely nothing about their neighbours, but who only talk about how distressed they feel now, akababaro ka bahutu, at present. It\\'s terrible and when I see it happening I ... I find it disheartening. That\\'s why I say: I wish there were a few Hutus with the good will to get together and say: “What can we do to repair the harm done?” What are the best actions to do that? Create a small foundation for example, help the orphans, the many children in Rwanda who are heads of households. Help the widows. Engage the young people. Have the courage to speak to the deniers, who are numerous both in and outside of the country, to say to them: “We have committed a crime and we must be able to forget.” Not to judge the current government. Have you seen a current African regime that doesn’t commit excesses? All regimes, and not only those in Africa ...—we talk about corruption in Rwanda, but is there a country without corruption? In this beautiful country [Quebec, Canada], we talk about corruption in the construction sector. There’s corruption everywhere. But it’s as if the opponents of the current regime in Rwanda focus on what is wrong in the country as a pretext to avoid the subject of the genocide. And I say: “These are two different things.” We can’t pass judgement on Kagame’s regime and mix it up with the genocide. We can’t talk about how opposition in Rwanda is muzzled and use that as a way to avoid talking about the genocide. These are two completely different things.[Sighs, expression of deep reflection] I would especially like to say a big thank you to the Montreal Tutsi community. I think the Tutsi survivors in Montreal are very brave. They’ve worked very hard, they’ve gotten involved in this project and they welcomed me. They welcomed me as a Hutu who wishes to express his sincere sympathy with what they have gone through and who ... they have understood that, yes, it’s possible that Hutus also participate in the rebuilding of our country. It is possible and, if ever Hutus can see this testimony, I’d like to say to them: “Let us have the courage to rebuild our country. Our country’s wounds are many. And many people have been terribly scarred. Let us have the decency and the humility to ask forgiveness and help these people at the time of their grieving. This time of grieving is painful for the majority of survivors.” Yes, there are some Hutus who have experienced misfortunes during the genocide. Some Hutu families have been decimated. Some Hutus died during the genocide. But they didn’t die because there was a genocide [directed?] against the Hutus. They died because of this genocide, they died because of the war, they died no doubt because of the retaliation of the RPF army, they died because of the consequences of this genocide. I would like those Hutus who show good will to be able to put things in perspective and to be able to...—and I would like to conclude on this point—if the Rwandan community of Montreal, both Hutus and Tutsis, if they could at some point commemorate their dead together, because the Hutus have also lost members of their families. That they be able to commemorate with the Tutsis saying, “Yes, we have also lost loved ones during this genocide, but let us build our country together. Let us be true brothers and not only in the rhetoric of demagogic speeches, let us be brothers because we are destined to live together in this small country and abroad, to share this Rwandan identity because we said no to Hutuland, to Tutsiland, and we are all Rwandans. We must continue to live together and that’s important. Let us truly forgive each other so that we can work together.”Well, I am Frédéric Mugwaneza, I am 32 years old, I am of Rwandan origin and I am Tutsi. My father was Jean-[Hus?] Mugwaneza, my mother—Annie Rolland. I have a brother, a big brother, and a big sister, Samuel Mugwaneza and Catherine Mugwaneza. I’m married to Sylvie Gasana and we have a little girl named Sarah.Yes, I remember well—I have fond memories of my grandparents on my father’s as well as on my mother’s side, because I spent quite a bit of time with them. I liked watching them, they fascinated me. I have always been fascinated by elderly people because they carry historical baggage and they have so much to tell. I remember better my—let’s say that I was closer to my paternal grandfather, his name was Eustache Kajuga. He was a pastor but, most of all, he was a decent man. Our family learned a lot from him. Whenever there were tensions or small issues in the family, he would calm things down. He would say comforting words to me and would explain to us how things should be done.He has influenced me, for sure. He left me many memories of family reunions—he loved family reunions, he really liked us being together and that’s something I have inherited from him. I enjoy being with my family, I enjoy family gatherings. So, I remember this grandfather well. I also remember my maternal grandfather, he was Belgian, his name was Jules Rolland. My memories of him are more about the games we played together. He showed me many things: we would go for walks, he was pointing out to me things in nature, little things—small examples that I liked very much.My grandmothers haven’t faded from memory either. I have a paternal grandmother who is still alive, her name is Marion. Like my paternal grandfather, the family gatherings were for her—she was always there, it was something important to her. She was also the one who helped my mother integrate—my mother was Belgian, and my grandmother was the one who helped her integrate into the family. It wasn’t easy for my mother when she first arrived, because she came from a different background, she was, as they say, a muzungu [white] and, well, it wasn’t easy. With time, the women’s help—it was the women who helped her integrate into the family and they opened the doors to her. I am thankful to my grandmother for that: for facilitating that, for helping my mother integrate and for considering her as one of the children in the family.My father was very respectful of his father, of my grandfather. In a way, my grandfather was viewed as a teacher, the one we would turn to when we needed an explanation, when we had a problem. Dad always viewed Grandpa as the head of the extended family. And it wasn’t based on fear, we weren’t afraid of our grandfather—he really was very nice—their relationship was quite—it was very friendly. Their connection—their discussions—my grandfather really was—he was at the centre of the family. On my mother’s side—because of the distance between them—she had decided to live in Rwanda—it was at first a little tense, well, a lot of tension, in fact, due to a lack of understanding: why did she move so far away? why did she leave? why did she go to live in Africa? The grandparents didn’t really understand my mother’s choice. So their relations were strained, but over time—they even came to visit us in Rwanda. That helped calm down the tension a little and things were going very well after that. My mother wrote to them all the time, I remember the letters in the mail, and my grandparents wrote back, they sent small parcels, biscuits, Belgian chocolates, which didn’t last for more than two days. And those are the memories I keep: of my grandparents in Belgium, who lived far away, who sent us little messages as expressions of affection, letters, small gifts, and then in Rwanda it was the lessons learned within the family, the discussions, the sharing of ideas. What I also remember, when I think of my grandparents in Rwanda, what first comes to mind is the countryside. They lived—my grandmother still lives there, in Gahini—every time we went there, I rediscovered the cows, the lake, the walks in the forest. I would play with the kids there, that’s where I learned Kinyarwanda. Life was simple there: family, nature and, of course, the Sunday Mass.Oh, yes, for sure, as soon as I would show up, they would say: “Umuzungu, umuzungu…” But as soon as we started talking, they could see that I was speaking Kinyarwanda and, well, the differences between us were quickly forgotten. And I really enjoyed walking around and playing outside with the kids on the hill. And—My mother, after 25 years in Rwanda, spoke perfect Kinyarwanda. She could communicate with anyone, she spoke Kinyarwanda very well, she was really well integrated, that’s precisely—the fact that she was engaged in the life of the family. She learned the language, she became a true Rwandan.Of course, they raised me based on their own experience. No doubt about that. My mother was educated—and I think my father too—in the old-fashioned ways where the father was the authoritative figure. And they tried to raise us in the same way—myself, my brother and my sister. But I didn’t fear my mother, we were close. And I was an agitated child; like everyone else, I was doing stupid things. When I did something really stupid, my mother would hit me sometimes, as a kind of punishment. She was trying to explain to me how I should behave, she had the mind of a psychologist. She would kneel down next to me and that’s how she talked to me—she had a more flexible approach to teach me to stop doing stupid things. My mother preferred talking to hitting. With Dad it was—he was quite flexible too, but his was a more African approach. We were slapped when we did stupid things, without much discussions, without much dialogue—there was some distance, [he was] a bit removed emotionally. It was similar to how all Rwandan dads are with their children: they remain at a distance, avoid being too close, too friendly with their children. I wasn’t too upset about it since I could see that it was like that in all other families. But it was also a way of fearing him, since we didn’t know how he would react; we were trying to guess his state of mind: is he going to be mad? is he in an agreeable mood?—so there was always this doubt. And then there was the way he looked at us. His gaze expressed a lot: he liked to frown, as if to say to me: “I’m not going to say much more, you understood me.” And I understood what—the message he wanted to convey.Yes, I have a little girl, she is still very young, so I don’t know. [laughter] My parenting skills haven’t been put to the test yet.She is one and a half. I think I will take some features from them both. I’m trying to have a close relationship with my child, to be able to talk to her, understand her concerns, talk to her, be close, but it’s also necessary to be firm sometimes.To be tough, yes. I’ll take features from both of them, for sure, from both Mom and Dad—because I turned out well. I don’t know if I was someone who—I was an agitated child, difficult to control. I was running everywhere, I broke things around me, and I think that they disciplined me well.Decisions that affected—that impacted life at home, for example, I think it was my mother who made those decisions at home. Now, well, all that was—the rest—[sigh]—I would say, those were Dad’s decisions—whether it was going on a trip, for example, or whether we had to go somewhere, it was Dad who decided when, because his schedule was—he had to look at his availabilities, because he was working a lot at the time. So it was more my Dad who was deciding to—when we would leave, where we would go. And at home, it was my mom who ran her house, her employees, she made sure that the whole house was clean. She hired the people who worked at home, she trained them, she taught them to cook, Dad never participated in this. Also, when there were difficulties in the family, it was often Mom who would pinpoint the problem and would ask Dad to do something about it. Sometimes—I’ll use the example of an uncle who was going to have his fifth child, and I remember that Mom went to see his wife, my aunt, she went to see her and she told her, “You’re going to have your fifth child, I think it should be your last one.” My mom defended women’s values, she fought for the emancipation of Rwandan women and when she saw a woman who had no say, who unwillingly had [children], many children and, well, when it looked like the husband had decided to have a child and the wife had no say in the matter—I remember that she had gone to see my aunt and tell her that she must not remain quiet and that if she didn’t want any more children, she shouldn’t have any because she isn’t a machine for babies. I remember hearing that discussion and I found it quite interesting.Lake Muhazi. And we would walk around the lake, we would take canoes and paddle on the lake. That’s the most significant memory of my childhood: spending time at the lake, with my family, at my grandparents’ house, beautiful landscapes, the sunset [inaudible: and all that?]Yes, my grandparents’ house was built slightly up the hill, higher up a little bit, it was surrounded by fields, there was a cow pen, and a small descending path. We would walk to the lake and stay there for a while, we had picnics there, we had meals together as a family, and then we would go out on the lake. Sometimes, I went out with the bashumba [cowherders]. I walked with them and their cows—I liked the cows—and I walked along with my little stick. These are for me beautiful memories. When I think about my childhood, I think how extraordinary it was. Innocence, I lived in complete innocence. It was beautiful.Yeah. I—on the level of—in terms of how sensitive I am, I’m much closer to my mother, and in terms of my attitude, the way I want to appear to others, I try to be like Dad. I try to—Dad was really loved by everyone. To this day, when I meet people who knew him, they speak well of him. I’ve never met anyone who has said to me, “Your dad did this or that to me…” Or, I don’t know…, “I didn’t appreciate…” That’s something that I feel deep down—to do good, to be a good person. He was the one who showed me how to be like that, how to treat others. And my mother taught me how to be sensible, how to talk to people in a certain way, to be interested in others. She taught me empathy, to put myself in other people’s shoes, to see their problems from their perspective. My mother was such a person. Like a psychologist, she talked to people, discussed their problems with them, if they had problems and if they wanted to talk about it… Yeah, that’s it.Yeah, that’s right. She was able to see problems that were not readily visible. She was sensitive in a way that I try to be too. I try to be interested when I see someone who has a problem, I ask myself—I try to see if I can help them. And Dad was more like the man everyone likes, who makes jokes, who puts people at ease. That’s it.A muzungu who spoke Kinyarwanda. And when people came over, they spoke Kinyarwanda to us. I even remember sometimes when I was leaving the house in the morning and when I would open the front gate, there was a line of four or five women waiting to talk to my mother, to tell her about their projects: “Oh, we’re trying to start a small cooperative” or “We want to start selling things at the market, we want to buy things to sell, fruits…” Every morning, there were two, three, four people waiting to talk to Mom, and Dad was grumbling all the time: “You see all these people coming to the house all the time to… You’re too kind, don’t let yourself be taken advantage of.” In any case, my mother really was a very caring person who helped people a lot. She was especially engaged in the cause of women. She was committed to the cause of the Rwandan woman, and she did a lot. And Dad too had made the most of—he had also succeeded. It was as if he wanted to give back to his friends who had helped him or his family. He was the leader in the family who was trying to encourage others to study, to start their own business. When people were about to get married, they would come to see him and ask him to participate in the expenses, it was—he also helped voluntarily. So those are the memories I have of my parents—their kindness.The eldest is Catherine, my sister, and the way I remember her in Rwanda—she left Rwanda when she was 16 years old because, well, it wasn’t going well at school and also I think she often spoke of Belgium; she wanted to go study in Belgium and I think my parents sent her to Belgium. So I—during my childhood, my adolescence, I didn’t know my sister very well. The only memory I had of her was her running with my brother in the garden—I was younger and they often played together. She looked after me as big sisters do, but we didn’t play together. She was a bit like a second mom to me when I was little—we didn’t play together much. I only have very few memories of Catherine from when I was a child. With my brother Sam, on the other hand, we grew up together; we played all kinds of games together. I was constantly trying to follow him, even though he didn’t want me to always be in his way. We played a lot together and we were also fighting a lot. My impression is that when boys play too much together they often end up smacking each other. We fought a lot. But we had fun. We are brothers and we had a very straightforward relationship.Well, for sure Sam was someone who—in terms of sports, he was very athletic and I wanted to be better than him. I remember, for example, we played sports at school—long jumps, high jumps—and we were very good at these sports. Every time we played, I thought to myself, “I must be better than him.” I was emulating him, I watched what he was doing. And with time, I became better at high jump—I wasn’t better at all disciplines, but I managed to surpass him in some. We have an age difference of two years, so while growing up I was also catching up with him. He instilled in me good sports values and a discipline at the level of—[inaudible] in sports. He showed determination and I tried to be like him. Determination. Also, the interest in cars, in all things mechanic—all of that comes from him. He was always—I always competed with him: if he liked doing something, I had to do it too. For example, he liked the Audi car brand, so I had to get a car from another brand, Peugeot. We were constantly competing. Same thing with soccer: during the World Cup he was cheering for Germany and I was cheering for France, just to be different from him. It really was—and these weren’t my personal choices, these were choices in relation to him: he had decided on one thing, so I had to choose something else.Yes, I wanted to be very different from him, but at the same time, he was my role model.Now it’s—with my sister, over time, we managed to make up a little for lost years. When I arrived in Belgium in 1994, she took charge of things and I got to know her better then. There was really a gulf between us because we didn’t know each other during—pff—a good ten years; I didn’t see my sister every day during that time. And there is still a feeling of distance between Catherine and I—no doubt, the distance of all the years we didn’t see each other. And also because we have different characters—I’m much closer to Sam in terms of character and in my way of being, more generally. He is still my role model: starting a family, having stability in life. Whenever I have important decisions to make, I go and talk to him, not to my sister. My sister and I, we didn’t grow up together, and I feel that growing up with my brother has brought me closer to him and whether it’s planning to start a family or talking about future projects, I talk to him about those things. Yes.My sister’s upbringing—the few years that I remember because she left at 16—well, things were quite conflictual at home because she didn’t get along very well with Dad. I don’t remember exactly why, but I think it had something to do with school, things were not going well at school and she also had a bit of a difficult character, so it was very—and with my mom too. My mom tried to be a mediator between them, but—but I can’t really make observations on the upbringing of girls, based only on the case of my sister. If I consider, rather, my cousins, it was—I didn’t notice anything particular. The girls played with the boys, we played together, there was no—Yeah, well, being at school was not an easy time for me, because from the start I wasn’t a good student. I didn’t put in the necessary effort to catch up with the others. It was as though I knew I wasn’t a good student and I thought, “Well, I’ll resign myself to do the minimum of effort.” I remember one of my teachers in particular—his name was Monsieur André, well, his name is still Monsieur André—he was my math teacher. Things were not going well between him and I in his classes. It was—I always had bad grades and he—well, he wasn’t trying to help me either. His was the class I didn’t like at all so my worst memories are from this math class at the École belge in Kigali—[laughter]—with my teacher, Monsieur André, who was very strict, and whom everyone feared, and I was the one bearing the brunt of his punishments: I had to clean the blackboard, anything that needed to be done, anything unpleasant, I was always the one to do it.Geography, history classes, drawing—I was very good at drawing—and also gym class, those were my favourite. I hated anything that had to do with science. And even—I remember one day, I brought home a marked math assignment, and I think he had given me something like two out of ten; I showed it to Mom and said, “Mom, what do you want me to do, I’m not good at math?” She said—she admitted that math was also her pet peeve, she said, “You know, math is not my strong suit either.” In fact, sometimes I showed her my [math] homework and she wasn’t able to correct it or to help me. And then my dad’s reaction, instead of trying to see if he could do anything [to help], was to say, “I’m going to get you private lessons, okay?” So there was this teacher who was coming to our house and who was trying to bring my math skills up to speed. It wasn’t easy, but I always managed to narrowly pass my math class. That’s it.At the time of the genocide—I can take as a starting point the 6th when the plane was shot down—I was in my bed, I was anticipating a normal night and going to school the next day. And then, around 6-7 o’clock in the evening, we heard the blasts. Two big explosions. We didn’t pay much attention to it, we thought it was grenades exploding in the surrounding areas. There were always the sounds of gunfire, grenades, even in our neighbourhood, which was rather quiet, we were always hearing the occasional shot and so we thought, “It must be a grenade.” So I went to sleep and in the morning—very early in the morning, around 5-6 o’clock—my mother came to wake me up and she said, “You’re not going to school today, the plane—the President is dead.” To me this was good news, I said, “Oh! I’m not going to school! That’s good!” The President is dead, well, we’re going to—the country will open up—because I was always hearing on the radio that the President was against the Arusha Accords, the President this, the President that, so I thought to myself, “Well, this is good news!” I saw that as the end of all of the country’s problems and I thought that everything was going to be all right in Rwanda. And we spent the morning—very early in the morning until—we even had breakfast around 8 o’clock. And then the shooting became much more repetitive; until then, shots were fired only occasionally, but at 8-9 o’clock the bombing started. And, well, we were beginning to—I could see my dad calling people left and right, he didn’t talk to me at all, I don’t remember my father talking to me that day or—at home that day, he was always on the phone, he was pacing back and forth. Without thinking, I went to the garden, I looked out, I saw houses being blown up, I saw grenades, [I heard] shots… Maybe I can provide a bit of context here. When I was a student at the Belgian School, I grew up in—I was like a child isolated from all the problems in Rwanda, ignorant of the ethnic groups, ignorant of Rwanda’s fundamental problems. I hadn’t paid attention to the different political movements, I thought of them as soccer teams—with their flags, their street demonstrations; to me they were like competing soccer teams. I never took them seriously. Even at school, I remember, I was classmates with the children of ministers, the children of high dignitaries. Kabuga’s children were also there, and Mbonyumutwa’s children, the children of all the military officers—almost all of them were there; I was friends with them. I remember at one point it became fashionable to wear small medals [points to his shirt] with the party symbol, and they were wearing those to school. I remember I was making fun of them, I was saying, “Your president is a dictator, he’s not letting the other parties express their voice! The MDR [Republican Democratic Movement] is no good.” I was saying that innocently, without really—just for fun. I knew that Dad was in the PL [Liberal Party] and I was proud to say it. I was saying, “Yeah, one must be a liberal!” I saw the liberals [the members of the Liberal Party] as—the very word, “liberal”—as free. We are free. So, at school, I boasted, I was always saying, “Oh, one has to be free, you are in movements, in parties led by dictators,” and things like that. There was never any aggression, never a threat on my part. And it went on like this. If a child had come up to me and had said, “Hey, you, we’re going to kill you” or if someone had attacked me, maybe then I would have seen the sign and I would have understood some of what was going on, but never, ever, was there a single complaint about—it was all for laughs… We were joking.So, yes, as I was saying, uh, I lived in my small world of a white [boy], Rwandan, Indian, it was all good, I didn’t—and so my cousin who lived at home with us always came home very early—very early, at 5 o’clock he was there. I was asking too many questions: “Why are you always home? Why aren’t you going out? Aren’t you going to play basketball?” Sometimes I played basketball in our neighbourhood, and I would say, “Come with me, we’ll play.” He was always afraid to go out of the house, especially in the few months before [the genocide], especially in late 1993, early 1994, he was always at home. One day he said, “Listen, my parents live in Nyamirambo and I go to an Apacope school [Parents’ Association for the Contribution and Promotion of Education].” And I said, “Why are you living with us? Why don’t go back to your parents’ house?” He said, “Because going back to Nyamirambo is more dangerous than coming to Kicukiro.” I said, “But why?” He said, “Because we get attacked sometimes in the street.” In the Nyamirambo neighbourhood—he had to walk through there, and he said that it was dangerous, that sometimes he got stopped by the police and that even in his family home in Nyamirambo there were often—the militia would pass by, soldiers would pass by, just like that, and observe the young boys who were there; he was a tall guy and older than the others. It was only afterwards that I realized that all the young people of that age were getting arrested from time to time, they would spend the evening in prison, they were beaten up. But at the time when he was telling me this, I thought he was being stupid. I said, “No. What are you talking about? No. Come, we’re going out, we’ll play basketball.” And he didn’t want to, he didn’t. Once, I came back home from playing basketball and I was singing, I was whistling in the courtyard of our house and he said, “No! You shouldn’t whistle, you shouldn’t whistle. If they hear you, they’ll come here.” I said, “Who?” He said, “The interahamwe! If they hear someone whistling, they’ll take it as a signal to come here—[inaudible: end the—?]” I didn’t understand what he meant at all. I said, “Are you delusional? What is—? Here, at home? We have caretakers in the house, Dad is well-known, nothing will happen. Mom too, Mom is a muzungu, they won’t touch a muzungu.” It was my innocence speaking.Very naive. And what really confused me in this whole story, all this drama in Rwanda, was my uncle. I had an uncle, Robert Kajuga, he was the little brother—he was the youngest son in the family, my father’s little brother. And when he was starting out, all the young people knew him very well because he had a soccer team. He was well-known, he had many girlfriends, really very well-known to the young people in the country. And he was spotted by the President’s clan and the members of the [inaudible] party and he was offered to be the head of the interahamwe in Kigali. He ended up becoming their president. When it happened, I found it extraordinary. I thought, “It’s really—the family is protected, the family is this and that…” And that’s—it was—afterwards, after everything happened, so after 1994, that’s what troubled me the most. And it’s the reason why I wanted to do this interview—on the one hand, to explain my version and get it out—it’s like a burden for me and my family. And no, it’s something that I’ve never understood and that I will never understand because he no longer exists, he is dead. But being the president of the interahamwe—it’s as though he wanted us to die… And—when he came over to our house or when we passed him on the street he was very nice. He grew up—I grew up with him, by his side, and everything was going well until he became involved in politics. After that there was tension in the family. I remember, he was about to get married and my grandfather talked with the girl’s father, and there were accusations: “Oh, he’s an interahamwe,” and this, and that… In any case, this whole story is very disturbing, how he got involved in this. My dad was meeting with his [other] brothers to talk about that. No one understood his [uncle’s] choices. What was clear was that he liked money, he loved success, visibility, and that everything was offered to him. So it’s really—he jumped on it for the profit, to make—for money and success, but I think he was naïve about it, he didn’t see the boundaries, he didn’t see what the repercussions would be, so, really, he jumped on it for the profit, to make—for money or for the—for success. But I think he was naïve about it, he didn’t see the boundaries, he didn’t see the—what the consequences would be.I hear a lot of people saying that his hands were tied during the genocide, that he’s saved some people but he’s killed others, so it remains—for me it will remain a mystery. And in a way, I think it’s better that he’s dead. I think it’s better because otherwise, it would have caused the destruction of the whole family. So that’s it. This is the part where I bring up my uncle, it’s also to address that confusion I lived with when I was young and that’s where—I also remember when Dad—when I asked him questions, I asked him—because I was thinking about my uncle, but also about my cousins \\u200b\\u200bwho were worried about being attacked, and I didn’t understand. One day I asked my dad, I said, “What is our ethnicity, in fact?” He laughed. My mother was right next to him, she didn’t say anything, and we just continued on with our day. Sam also asked, “Yes, what is our ethnicity? We are in the Liberal Party and they say that the people there are Tutsi. You’re saying that we have to put the small—” We had to wear the small medallion with Habyarimana’s, the President’s, picture on it. My dad would put it on when he was going to conferences. Sam said, “But sometimes you wear the small President’s medallion, so what are we, after all?” He said, “We are like everyone else, you know, we are Hutu.” And we never spoke about that again. And so I grew up thinking that. I continued on with my life, time passed. In my mind, I was Hutu. And it all made sense: my uncle was president of the interahamwe—that was confirmed and [my response] to my cousin who was worried was, “No, our family is protected, don’t worry, nothing will happen.” And so, with all these elements in place, the plane crashed in the night of April 6 and then, in the morning, my mom woke me up very early and said, “The President is dead.” And then—well, then we started hearing gunshots, and around 11–11:30 in the morning they were still announcing on the radio that we should stay inside our houses, remain calm, stay at home, stay inside. And then around noon, half past twelve—I remember, we were sitting at the table—that’s the image I have from that day, we were sitting at the table—like Jesus’ Last Supper. Dad was there, Mom, my cousin, another cousin was there too. It was as though we were going to have our last meal, everyone felt that, and I too ended up understanding that there was tension, something that I couldn’t grasp, couldn’t understand. No one spoke, no questions. We were hearing gun shots, but we were going to have a meal. I believe we ate a little bit. We hadn’t finished yet when we heard the doorbell ring and there were—grandfather was there too.That’s right, but I thought that maybe if we went to the other side, they wouldn’t find us there. Anyway, when you’re in the moment, you don’t think too much, you try to follow your instinct. So we left the house and we went behind the small cistern. From there, I glanced back, I saw the front gate and the soldiers coming in, I quickly looked back and I saw a barrage of soldiers going in and the door was—we had to go through an open area [in the garden], we had to cross maybe five meters to get to the gate that would take us to the neighbours’. So I thought, “If we go through there they will see us and they will shoot us. So I say we go back.” We went back to the house, because they already had—they were circling the house. I said, let’s go back inside, maybe nothing will happen to us. We tried to run away, but I think it would have been disastrous. So we went back into the house and we waited. The soldiers arrived, they circled the house, they came inside, we were all there gathered in a group. There were ten of us and they placed guards, […] arms in the air—so, they invaded the house completely, soldiers everywhere, they asked us to go out, to go on the terrace. We obeyed. And at that moment, an atmosphere of death reigned, a feeling that this was the end. Some things you just feel and you think to yourself “it’s over.” So there we were, on the terrace, waiting.One day after the attack. So we were all there, waiting. The soldiers were searching the house. One of them came out, I think he was a colonel or—I don’t remember, but he was the leader. He came out and told Dad to go inside and bring everything he had, whether it was money or—and to show him where he was hiding the weapons. He was talking to him in Kinyarwanda, of course, and in a violent way, he was pushing him: “Go, go, show me the weapons—and your money—bring out everything!” We were still gathered outside, on the terrace. I remember I took cover close to my mom, I asked her, “What’s going on? Why are they—? What are they going to do?” And she said, “Stay quiet! Stay calm. What is bound to happen will happen, but you are here with me.” Those were the last words she said to me. During that time Dad was inside, I didn’t know what was going on, where he was. I couldn’t see him, but I could hear the sounds of cupboards falling down, windows breaking—they were throwing everything on the ground, as if they were looking for something. The leader with whom Dad left came out of the house and he was discussing something with the other soldiers, he was talking to them. We couldn’t hear anything and that’s when I broke my silence. I walked towards him, I came close, but not too much, and I spoke to him, I said, “Ntambunda dufite, ntacyintu dufite, turi abantu beza, ntacyintu twakoze.” I tried to tell him that there was nothing, that we were pacifists, that we hadn’t done anything, that—and even if I didn’t understand the issue of why they were there, I understood that they were looking for something and that we were in a bad situation. The soldier standing right next to him and holding a rocket launcher turned towards me and pushed me back with it, with his rocket launcher. It took me—I really felt how hot it was and he pushed me back towards Mom and said, “Ceceka wambwa we!”—“Shut up!” So, I really—I burst into tears and took cover close to my mother who didn’t speak and just hugged me. Then the colonel, the leader who was talking with the others, he went back into the house and the soldiers told us, “Go to the garden and lie down on the ground on your stomachs, and do not say a word. We don’t want to hear a sound from you.” That’s when I thought that those were our last moments—what are we going to do? Should we run? Should we flee? Should we keep our hopes up—maybe they were only pretending? So many questions. I was wondering what—I’m sure the others were asking the same questions, except they knew why they were there, they knew very well what was going to happen while I didn’t know it yet. I said to Mom—I remember asking her, “And what about Sam? Sam and Catherine?” They were in Belgium, they had left to study there well before this took place, so they were in Belgium—I told her, “What—” I said, “Sam and Catherine?” She smiled and squeezed me in her arms. That’s when she told me these last words, “What’s bound to happen will happen, you’re here with me, everything will be all right!” We then went down to the garden, all ten of us, and lay on the ground. And I don’t know how—it was fate—I lay down in such a way that my mother was partly lying on top of me—we were lying on our stomachs—and she placed herself partly on top of me and she wrapped her arm around me as if to protect me from what could happen. So we were all lying on the ground and there was maybe—we heard the sounds of boots moving left and right, a lot of jostling, and then—there really were a lot of soldiers there, I don’t remember how many, but at least thirty for sure—and there was a hubbub that I can’t even describe, the house was so crowded—they were breaking the windows—and at one point, I heard the words—they were talking to each other—I heard, “Shoot! Shoot fast, fast!” And he said, “Aim at the heads, aim at the heads—in this way it’ll be done quickly and then we’ll go.” And then I heard shots, they were starting. They were shooting at us, one after the other. They were at a distance of two meters away, a little above us, at the level of the terrace, we were a little below and they were firing, but I didn’t see anything, because we had our heads to the ground and we couldn’t see anything. I could only hear the shots, I didn’t raise my head, they had forbidden us to look, and I said to myself, “If I get up or do anything like that, it’s over.” My mother still had her arm around me and was holding me tight, she didn’t speak, and they started to shoot at us, one shot at a time. I didn’t hear any groans, no noise. They were shooting, shooting. I thought I was hearing the shots coming closer and I could see, I could feel a head jerk. I could feel it was getting closer, it was getting closer… I could feel the heat. And then it hit my mother, I felt her body jerk, two-three times, I don’t remember how many, I think they shot at her three times and I didn’t hear any noise, she didn’t make any noise, “and now it’s my turn,” I said to myself, “it’s me, it’s my turn.” And I heard like a—the ground trembled, and I felt, close to my face, the sensation of heat, and then very close, between my legs, the ground trembled, my body was still tense, and then it continued on to the next person. It continued on, there were three more people, it passed on to them. It was like I was trying to feel the pain, as if I was trying to—I tried to move, to see where I was hurt, where it—I couldn’t feel anything. I thought, “Maybe I’m already dead.” And I thought that if this was death, maybe it wasn’t so bad, there was no pain. My hand was placed on my mother’s neck, I tried to wake her up, but they were still shooting. I tried to calm down a little. Then finally the shooting stopped, and I heard the sounds of boots. I heard the soldiers speaking: “Go get him too!” And then I heard my father’s voice, coming from somewhere, I could guess where he was standing, he was in front of us, looking at us… He said, “What have you done! Mwakoze iki? Huh! Oya, Mwakoze ibiki!” And then I heard, “Go! We jyenda nawe! Go, you go too.” Then I heard him quickly going down the stairs, trying to escape. He stepped in front of me, right near my head and, yes, I heard footsteps, he ran, and they shot him three or four times. I heard his breathing, the sound of his body falling to the ground, I felt his—I felt his despair, I felt his—I felt that he realized this was the end, I felt all that. He saw his family decimated, he then tried to meet his death head on, and he fell to the ground… I heard his body falling dawn. And that’s when I realized I was alive, that I wasn’t dead, that I was still there and that he had fallen. Then the soldiers, they—I think they were checking to see if we were dead, if anyone was still alive, but they didn’t examine too closely and they continued on their way. They said, “We have to go someplace else, we’ll leave now and we’ll come back.” They left. And while—at that time, I believe, the tension was so intense, that I fainted, I lost consciousness. Maybe ten minutes later, I was awakened by groans, cries from pain. The three zamus were injured. No, actually, two were still alive and one of them was dead. The two were crying out from pain. I also heard my grandfather who was groaning, but the others—silence. My mother was right next to me, but I didn’t dare lift my head. During the whole time, I kept my head to the ground and I had mud, dirt in my mouth, in my nose, my glasses were broken, so I couldn’t see much, and I didn’t breathe. I was breathing heavily, but I tried not to make any noise. I managed to turn my head to look at my mother: her eyes were closed and—she wasn’t moving. I tried to pinch her, I tried to make her move a little, but I saw no sign of life and no sign of suffering—her face was impassive, no blood… I raised my head a little, I saw my grandfather, he was wounded in the arm, his arm was completely—I don’t even know if it was an arm or—it was shredded. And the same thing with his thigh—and he was an old man. It was a horrific scene. I didn’t understand how he could still be alive. The caretakers too were seriously wounded, and were crying out from pain. And I saw that—I asked them if someone—if they can still see the militiamen, if they—I tried talking to them and they said, “No, they are gone!” That’s when I tried to sit up, I felt my body. My hand was a little injured, but I was alive and I had no—I wasn’t seriously hurt. So I tried to—again, I took the initiative; I thought to myself, “I am able to move, I will get them out of here.” I remembered that Dad had been on the phone, he was talking to—before the soldiers arrived, he was talking on the phone with—I didn’t know if he was a minister at the time, but anyway—he was talking to Justin Mugenzi.He was the president of the Liberal Party. I remember he was talking to him, so I said to my grandfather, “Dad was talking to Justin, he’s a minister, he can help us, he has soldiers to protect him. I’ve seen him surrounded by soldiers.” Which is more, he lived next door to us. So he [the grandfather] was able to speak, and he—he reached for—he managed to get his address book and gave me Justin’s number. He said, “That’s right, try calling him and tell him we’re wounded.” So I took the number, I ran inside the house, I got to the phone and I called him. His daughter answered, or one of the employees there did, I don’t know. I asked to speak to Justin, I told him very quickly, “We’re wounded, Dad is dead, there is no one left, grandfather is wounded—come quickly!” and I hung up. I went to the window, I didn’t dare going in the garden again, I stayed inside, and I thought, “I just spoke to him, he will come! He will come get us.” I barricaded myself inside the house, I shut the doors closed, I went into the kitchen—it was like I wanted to search the house completely for anyone that might still be there. I went to the kitchen, took a knife and I remember I ran around the house looking for someone who was maybe still there, who had stayed inside, and then I waited. I stationed myself in front of the window overlooking the entrance gate. I waited to see if anyone would come, and then—when—after maybe 10 or 15 minutes, I saw soldiers coming in again, and I recognized their faces. I thought to myself, “The same people are back.” And I thought, “But why are the same people back?” I thought about that for a few seconds, I didn’t understand why they came back—I had spoken with Justin—why hadn’t he come? And then I said to myself, “They’ll look for me and they won’t find me downstairs with the others. I have to hide.” I hid in the attic, it was very high up, but I found inexplicable strength and managed to climb. I hid there and waited. I was hiding in the attic and I was waiting… I could hear them walking around the house, looking for me. And then they stood in front of the bodies and started shooting, they were shooting at the bodies—they shot dead my grandfather, they shot dead the zamus and I think they even shot the others again because they were shooting so much. Then they shot the windows of the house, to make me come out. When they understood that I wasn’t going to come out, they didn’t try to go inside again, they left. They left, and I stayed in the attic, traumatized. I waited, I panicked, I didn’t know what to do. I think I stayed there, in the attic, for 30 minutes perhaps. I didn’t hear a sound except gunfire in the neighbourhood. And then, 30 minutes later, I heard the voice of one of my classmates, Gustave Mbonyumutwa, we studied together at the École belge, we were in the same class. I could hear him, he was talking to me, he said, “Kiko, it’s me, I came to get you. Come! Don’t be afraid.” I didn’t move. I didn’t understand why he was there, what was he doing there. He walked around the house and I could hear him speak with someone else, and then I noticed he was accompanied by a soldier—from the attic, I could hear what was going on in the house. He kept calling me, “Kiko, come out, don’t be afraid! You’re not risking anything.” Some minutes passed, I thought to myself, “If I stay here, I will certainly die, so I might as well go downstairs and be done with it. What good is my life now, anyway?” So, I went downstairs. I went downstairs and I saw him standing in front of the entrance and I spoke to him, I said, “Are you sure that nothing will happen to me? Are you sure that—why is there a soldier here, with you? What will he do to me?” He said, “No, he’s here for our safety, I’m going to take you to my house uptown”—they lived a little further up, in Kicukiro. He said, “I’m going to take you home, you’ll be safe.” He said, “I know what happened, you’ll come home with me.” Well, I said—I opened the door, I went outside and nothing happened. He said, “Follow me, the soldier will walk behind us, he will act as if he had found us and he’s taking us somewhere to—” So, we left the house. I remember I quickly took with me one jacket and a few small items, documents, I think, my identity papers. And then I left with him. We walked up the road to his house and we passed by groups of men in the street, the soldiers were everywhere. He took me to Matayo Ngirumpatse’s house—the houses were—Mbonyumutwa [inaudible]. It was—they lived next door to each other, and our house was not too far either. And since we knew each other a little bit—my mother knew Mathieu’s [Matayo?] wife—so I thought that—and Mathieu’s daughter was also at the École belge, like me—so I felt reassured, I felt a little bit safe, except when we got there, there were tanks, plenty of soldiers and—but at least I recognized the faces of people I knew from school. I stayed there. When I entered the house, I saw a whole bunch of people that I didn’t know, men that I hadn’t met yet, but Gustave’s dad, Shingiro Mbonyumutwa, was also there, he came up to me, shook my hand and said, “My condolences.” I remember those were his first words to me. He said, “My condolences.” So he was already aware of everything that had happened—but why is he telling me that? He knew that my parents were dead. In any case, it was a—I felt—I was shaken, in a state of shock. But nothing happened in that house, he even treated my wound. I was wounded here [shows his wrist] and they treated me, they gave me food, and an hour or two later Rose, Matthew’s wife who knew my family, handed me the phone and said, “It’s your brother in Belgium, he wants to talk to you.” I said, “You called him already? What am I going to tell him?” She said, “Tell him what happened.” So I took the phone, and—Sam was on the other end of the line and he said, “Are you okay? What are you doing there? Is everything all right?” I didn’t know what to say, I was searching for my words, and then I think I told him, “Our parents are dead.” Then I think I heard the sound of a person collapsing, I don’t know, a noise… Later, I learned that he had to sit down from the shock, he was a little—and then he asked me to repeat, “What?” “Our parents are dead, and I’m wounded, and I’m here, but—” Just pronouncing the words “our parents are dead” was already the—I had said everything. I don’t think we talked about anything else. I handed the phone back to Rose and she hung up or she spoke to him—I don’t remember anymore… I stayed there that night. I slept there. The next day, they had to take me to the—I think they contacted the Belgians or they called UNAMIR [United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda], but I think no one was able to come to the house because of the gunfire and all that. I think the gunfire was getting closer and—we had to move, we had to leave the house because they themselves were no longer safe. So I followed everyone, the whole group that fled Matayo’s house where we were; there were other people there, many, many other people, refugees. We left in a single file and we went downtown, we went past the house where I lived. I asked that we stop there so that I could go in and get some things that I wanted to take with me. There was also something that was bothering me: the dead bodies were in the garden and it had rained; I said to myself, “Can we cover them with something?” So even at 17 years old I thought—I already had that—like I had a mission: I had to cover them. I went back to the house and I went inside, I got my father’s passports, some important documents, identity papers, and then we covered the bodies quickly because we had to hurry up, the gunfire was approaching, and it was very dangerous at that point. I went back in the car and then the whole row of vehicles left. We drove through the city centre, we drove to what was at the time the Hôtel des Diplomates, and everyone—it was like a refugee camp, everyone was there. It was full of people. A lot of people. But I was alone, and I don’t know who called the United Nations, the Belgian army. All I know is that a Belgian army jeep was waiting for me and I got in. And while I was walking in corridors of the Hôtel des Diplomates, going towards the Jeep, I ran into Justin Mugenzi. I remember that we walked past each other, he looked at me, he looked at me, we walked past each other, then he turned away. We did not speak. But the expression on his face was like saying, “What are you doing here?” Or, “How come you are here, what is—” No explanation about what had happened. In short, I found myself in the Belgian army jeep and they brought me to the Belgian refugee camp. A small improvised camp for the families of the Belgians was set up in front of the École belge. There, yes, I found a younger cousin who was—whose father was Belgian too, so we reunited there. And from then on I was alone with my little cousin. I think we slept there one more night. So I stayed for two nights after the 7th, so on the 9th, all the Belgians—I ended up with the Belgians, the foreigners—and all the French who were there too—we left in a military convoy with the French army towards the airport and we took the back roads, we didn’t take the main roads, the main streets, but we ended up reaching the airport. And then we left. I arrived in Belgium and—once there, well, I met with my brother and sister at the airport. Yes, that’s about it… Anyway.What are the rest of the questions like? It’s—Are we continuing the interview now? Okay. Uh, well, when I arrived at the airport in Brussels my brother and my sister were there, along with some friends, and—it was quite emotional, we burst into tears, I threw myself into my brother’s arms, into my sister’s arms. A team of psychologists was also there to help the people who needed care, but I have always refused—I don’t—I have always refused the help of psychologists, I don’t know why. I’ve always wanted to heal by myself, but—maybe because I simply didn’t feel sick. There was this one psychologist who came up to me many times, and she would always say, “Frédéric, come to see me!” Sometimes I went to her house and her children were around, she made me feel comfortable. She would say, “You can talk to me if you want to.” But every time I would start to talk, I would stop. I didn’t find it was something I needed. Maybe I should have done it, I don’t know, but it’s—I didn’t like talking about what had happened, I didn’t like telling my story. [pause] And my family too, my aunts—I have family—my mother’s sisters were in Belgium and one of my aunts, Mary Jane, was telling me, “Really, if you need to talk, we are here for you, we can help you.” I received support in Belgium, but every time [I was about to talk] I wasn’t too—I was a little reluctant, I didn’t like to speak, I kept things inside. Even to my brother, I didn’t always talk to him about what had happened, and every time I did speak about it, I would think of another detail to add, and they were all interested and would say, “Ah…, but you didn’t tell us this before.” And—I don’t—in any case, I feel like I’m a bit like my mother who experienced hardship in her life, but who always hid her suffering. I never saw my parents suffer, really: they have always hidden their pain, so maybe—my mother more so than my father, because my mother had to face many challenges: the fact of having returned—having left her family, her arrival in Africa, her integration in Rwanda, she had gone through many stages and she was a woman with the spirit of a fighter, very driven. Maybe I drew my strength from her. And especially the fact that she gave her life for me, I have the feeling that I have internalized that, I have her strength, she infused something in me, and often when I have problems, when I don’t feel well, I think of her, and it’s like she is talking to me, saying, “It will be okay, persevere, it will be okay, keep going, we’re here.” I feel her support in this way.That’s a good question. I’ve often thought about it. I’ve tried to find explanation within the Protestant religion, I was going to both churches, to the place of worship and to the church, I always—I grew up with the Sunday Mass, which wasn’t always easy, we didn’t always want to go, but I come from a religious family, on both sides. I try to tell myself that—well, it’s true that God—God—ultimately, that’s a big question, it’s quite, uh—but I don’t think religion can provide answers for everything—not for everything. I’ve often asked myself the question: “Uhm, what is this message for? Is this my calling, a mission that I have to accomplish?” I haven’t found the answer yet. Sometimes when I pray, or when I’m praying with someone else, it feels good. But I haven’t found the answer yet as to why I am still alive or what really happened. I’m still asking these questions. I think about that a lot.Umugwaneza—well, I often wondered, “Huh, what does it mean?” The answer that comes to my mind is, “Ah…! I am at the right place at the right time!” [laughter] I remember that I asked my dad this question once, or maybe I asked someone else, I said, “Does it mean that your timing is right or that you were born lucky or that you are—?” He laughed; he said, “No, it’s—” It’s only afterwards that I understood the meaning.He said that it meant someone who brings goodness to others, who helps others. Someone who is interested in people, who addresses the concerns of others. I don’t know if that’s the real meaning, but that’s what he told me.Yes, we can see it like that, he was a victim or maybe he was a weak person, easily swayed. But in some cases—and I’m sure that different families experience such things in a different way—but it must not lead to the—[inaudible] pain, because what happens sometimes is that there are bad people in Rwanda who will criticize my grandmother or my family, who would say, “Ah, but you have an uncle who did this and who did that.” It’s not easy being part of this family. Sometimes it seems to me it’s more difficult to bear because there are two sorrows: the grief of losing someone and the grief of knowing that this person has also caused suffering. But I think that’s what a genocide is: the genocide harmed everyone, and it’s—And I think it’s regrettable that—especially while I was living in Belgium—I found myself—I ran into them often, because they also lived there. They were walking in complete freedom and I often ran into them and every time I did, I had the impression that I was indebted to them for something, for my life. Still, it is quite—if I were in their place, I would have done exactly the same, but I wouldn’t have boasted that I am a hero, that I have saved so and so. The facts are there. Even if we can’s apply the same sentence to a child, someone who—let’s take Mbonyumutwa’s case—he said blatant things on the radio, his message was full of hate, but I can’t judge children by the same standard, because in my mind children are innocent and I would say “thank you” to the person who has saved me if I meet him on the street one day, but to the family—the people who have committed—who have spoken on the radio, who have uttered messages of hate—even my uncle—that’s why I said that it’s better that he died because if he were still alive I don’t think I would have forgiven him. And if I had to go to court, I would have stood there and accused him, I would have been the witness of—I would have testified because we have to fight this ideology, the ideology of eliminating people on the pretext that they are—whether they belong to this or that ethnicity or whether they represent this or that group. This ideology must be killed—not the people, but this ideology must be killed.Well, I lived in Belgium for ten years and I would summarize those ten years in Belgium like this: I tried to find my path, I got closer to my family in Belgium whom I didn’t know very well, I grew closer to them, my mental health improved, so to speak. And then it just so happened that I crossed paths with my wife, Sylvie Gasana, in Rwanda while I was there for the holidays. And we kept in touch for years while I was living in Belgium. After a few years she came here, to Canada, to study. I visited her during the holidays and I finally decided to move here. So, it’s for a reason close to my heart that I am here, and I also liked the city. I moved here, so—it was an easy thing to do and for me it represents, really, a second, even a third life. After life in Rwanda, the genocide, the life of adaptation in Belgium, for me Canada is a like the life of the—things are like—A new beginning and everything falls into place, everything is good, it really is like a third life I’m living. Yes. And I’m integrating very well. It’s—people’s mentality here is different than in Europe, it’s easier to integrate here, we find an important [inaudible: multiculturalism?]; so we feel—we don’t feel like strangers in this society and—The groups don’t talk to each other, each ethnic group has its bars they go to—there is a bar for the Hutus and a bar for the Tutsis. But I tend to follow the path of the Rwandan government, not talking about it and integrating everyone. After what we’ve lived through, it doesn’t—I don’t know, what’s the point of going back to that? For me, that’s rhetoric of the past and it’s a pity that people [inaudible: buy into?] it, it’s—we really need to move forward and—but the important thing is—every time I speak with a Hutu friend, if I don’t get an insight into his opinion about the genocide, we can’t become friends. Something that needs to be clear, whether with the Hutus or the Tutsis, is this: there was a genocide, it was committed by the Hutus to eliminate all Tutsis. That is clear. If we are to modify this view, that’s something I use as a basis to decide whether to become friends with someone or not. Yeah.[laughter] What time is it? I don’t even know!In terms of my story, my experience, yes, well— [short break in the recording]  I don’t talk about my story constantly, every day, but my family, my wife’s family here in Canada, they are well aware of what I have lived through, and I took solace, so to speak—I found a family again, after losing mine, and that’s what has always motivated me since the loss of my parents: I’ve always wanted to rebuild my family, to recover a little bit the emotions that I felt before and, uh, I’ve grown. We were a big family, we would get together, we had family gatherings every week and I rediscovered that here, with my wife’s family, and it’s very nice, it’s comforting. When I speak about it, I can freely tell my story and it’s important that the children—when my daughter is old enough to understand more serious things, I will tell her about it and I will especially like to teach her the neutral values \\u200b\\u200bof the—about what happened in Rwanda. To explain things in a concrete way, but without fueling hatred. If every parent did that, I think the results would be good. To live with the past, with the wounds of the past and to pass them on to another generation, that’s not helpful at all. We see it in conflicts around the world and it doesn’t help, it only perpetuates hatred. And I think that if we, the survivors like myself, can advance this message and say, “Well, we’ve suffered, we’re not even going to ask for your forgiveness, but the future generations and us, we are even now, so we are going to stop this.” I think that can give us some sense of peace. But what is important is the recognition of what happened, the negationism is not—cannot be tolerated. For me, that’s the basis for—if that’s something we don’t recognize, it’s—a dialogue is not possible—but—yeah, that’s it.Yes, it’s—you want to scream to their face, to shake them, to—but my feeling is that responding with violence won’t change anything, the best we can do is, I think, to have a discussion. And especially us, the survivors, especially the people who have suffered, the first victims, so to speak—it is our mission to talk about it, to say, “It really happened, there really was a genocide, this is what happened to me, this is what happened to others.” Talking about it. And, in relation to that, if—I believe that the negationist message will be silenced. That is why, I don’t think it’s right to prevent these people from speaking, because the message will then never be buried and it will continue [to be spread] within their families and little by little they will—while if they speak openly about it, okay, the message is in the public sphere, for everyone to see and hear and it is up to us to do the groundwork, to say, “They say this, but our experience is different.” And I believe that an eyewitness account compared to a negationist message—which is non-existent, or which is nothing more than words—I believe that a lived story is stronger than an invented story. We do not rewrite History. History exists and there are people for whom it is a concrete lived experience and we are here to say that out loud. The more numerous we are, the more that negationist message will be silenced, but we must talk about it and, by the way, that’s what I often say to my cousins \\u200b\\u200bin Rwanda who don’t want to talk about what happened, or who are still hurting deeply, or who dare not talk about it: to talk, to get it out, to tell what happened—that’s very important.When I was there, I met many of my old friends and they feel a little abandoned by all these new Rwandans who have arrived from abroad and who haven’t really taken the time to integrate them, to integrate these older Rwandans who had been there, we call them “the Sopecyas.” It’s as if the country has begun anew; we started from zero and we forgot everything that was there before. The older ones, they are a little overlooked. I often talk with my friends who live there and it’s as if no one wants to hear their stories anymore, they’re told to forget it all and to—that it’s a return to the past. I hear that often, this message, this discourse: to forget and to move on. But every month of April, these people—well, April is a month of mourning and we can’t ignore the genocide, I think, even if we become—even if one day we become the richest country in Africa or something like that, the genocide will always be part of Rwandan history and the people who have experienced it directly must be placed front and centre in connection to it, they must be respected, they must respect their rights because they are [inaudible] that open and they really are the first victims of the genocide.No. But the example I usually give is of a friend who was wounded during the genocide, he had been hit with a machete all over his body. He’s still in pain from his injuries and he’s struggling to live his life, to find work, just to find a house, to find something to eat, he’s always chasing after a job—he’s trying to survive. There are organizations and things in place for the survivors, but it’s—it’s either badly managed or it’s not efficient enough, or, anyway—and his injuries hadn’t healed completely, he would often show me his scars and I’d think to myself, “Isn’t the government helping you heal or shouldn’t it send you abroad for treatment?” Well, time passed, his injuries worsened and—there are things in place, I know that there are organizations to help the survivors, but it looks like they are not doing enough. If this person came here, abroad, he would have been treated, he would lead a more pleasant life. Sometimes I have the impression that all genocide survivors are left to fend for themselves, that they have been abandoned. We take for granted that “it’s all over now, everyone has healed, we must move on,” but it’s not possible, eh, we must—there are people who are still sick, who are suffering, but who don’t speak about it simply because they don’t have the framework or the—there are no resource people for that, to help them with that.Yeah, our Rwandan mentality is to be a little withdrawn; we don’t like to talk about our lives just like that. But I say to myself that the more eyewitness accounts there are, the more—those people, precisely, who are a little inward-looking, who don’t want to tell their story, they would look up to us as an example and would speak up. And the more stories are told, the more—because talking is healing; through talking we sometimes find answers, if we don’t, well, at least the people who heard what we had to say can help us. But for sure if we don’t talk, it’s—living is more difficult, life is harder and there is—and especially when you’re in Africa or Rwanda, it’s even harder, that’s for sure, yeah.At the same time, it was necessary to rebuild the country. I can also understand that we cannot be worrying only about the sick and the survivors, and making sure that all is well—there is also a country to rebuild, no doubt, but there has been a lot of international aid—aid that was directed especially towards the survivors. I’m not saying that all is bad, because many projects worked out well, for sure, but my impression is that we’re not doing enough. We’re not doing enough and we don’t give survivors a chance to succeed in life. Many of their anchor points have changed: the language is in the process of—many of the survivors are francophones and now Rwanda is switching to English. Also, the mentality, the old Rwandans’ ways of doing things are different from those of the Rwandans who have just arrived. So some of their bearings have been lost, that’s for sure. Yeah, that’s for sure.Well, at the community level, I try to help as much as I can in my field of work, computer science; as soon as there is something that needs to be done, I try to get involved. And I certainly would like Sarah to grow up knowing what it means to be Rwandan. If she can, as soon as the opportunity presents itself—even if it’s only learning Kinyarwanda, taking Kinyarwanda lessons or dance classes, I’m going to try to sign her up for—to teach her what Rwandan culture is; the little that I know, some of which I have lost in the meantime, maybe I could teach her what I know. Since we live far from the country, if we do nothing, well, we lose the thread a little bit, we lose the notion of what we know about the Rwandan community, about Rwandan culture… I think I am tired now. [laughter]Looking back, I find that the two of them complemented each other. They were both involved in our upbringing, and above all, it was done with a lot of love. It was also clear that their goal was for the kids to be raised well and to study because that was one of the legacies our parents cared about the most. They wanted all their children to be educated in order to be well prepared for the future.My family was very sociable, very loving towards others. Working was important too. One specific memory I have of many of my relatives is that they always had goals to achieve, always had a list of things to do. Even my parents were like that, they often talked about the projects they wanted to do in the coming year. Me too, I find that I often have projects, even though sometimes I can’t complete them.The school was a bit farther from the house, about a two-hour walk.We left the Kanyinya sector and we started third or fourth grade, I don’t remember very well. But I remember that in fourth grade we were studying at a place that was very far away—that’s the place I was telling you about and that it took us two and a half hours to get there. It was in Shyorongi. We started school in the morning and finished in the evening, I think we started at half-past eight and finished at four, so I always got home at seven o\\'clock.You learned it from your parents, because we talked all the time and they would raise the question of Hutus and Tutsis. There was no way of not knowing, because on our way to school we would pass—we would see Twa and we thought they were funny. So we knew that there were the ethnic groups of the Twas, the Hutus and the Tutsis. That’s how I knew, I think, but I became more aware of it in the classroom, when I developed an inferiority complex when I had to stand up and when I saw that the Twa student was even more embarrassed than I was to be the only one standing while the others were making faces at him.The teachers treated us all equally, especially since the teachers at these centres were all Tutsis, at least the ones I know of, and I know this because they were killed during the genocide. They have left this world; for some, their whole families were exterminated. The majority were Tutsi, maybe their supervisors were Hutu.I don’t know what the others did, but in my case my parents helped me, especially my father. I was interested in social work—in fact I continued my studies in this field after I came here. My father said that it was a good choice for my future and that people who study social work can go to law school; he said it was a good direction. So that’s how he helped me, but I don’t know about the others.I didn’t spend time on that. I was rather looking for ways to become self-employed, especially because finding a job…—sometimes it was very difficult. Many doors were closed, so we preferred to try something else.Raising children in the city is very different from raising children in the village. In the village, each child has tasks to do and he knows what he has to do even if he shares his tasks with others. But in the city, the kids didn’t have tasks, but had, rather, people doing things for them. So it was only after, when they were grown, that we wanted to teach them how to do some of the housework chores, and it was difficult. For example, we asked the boys to wash their own clothes, but they would damage them. And that’s what was different between us, who had grown up in the village, because we knew that no one else was going to do it for us. Everyone took responsibility for their own things, including washing their clothes, but that’s not the case with kids who have grown up in the city, because they knew they had people doing things for them. So, integrating them in the housework was a problem at first, but little by little, it worked. They weren’t given many tasks. Their job was to study, and people did the rest for them, and it was like this until high school when the older boys started washing their clothes on Saturdays and Sundays, but they didn’t do this for too long because we left Rwanda to come here. I think the girls were even younger. They didn’t have any household chores to do, but sometimes we reminded them to make their beds, for example. They would agree to do it, but they knew that there would be someone else who would finish the work for them. So, in terms of housework, it was very different.It’s the same problem of Hutus and Tutsis. In 1973, they decided to expel Tutsi children from schools. I remember very well how it all started in my high school. It happened one morning and we were scared. We saw one of the teachers, her name was Victoria Nsaza—Nsanzubuhoro. She was an older mother and she saw that we were curious. We were three students in ninth grade, I think, and we were standing [outside the school] and talking. One was telling us that she had heard that in Saint-André they had started cutting people with machetes and the students had been expelled. The other one was telling us that it had started nearby, at the Medical Assistants school. We then went up the stairs towards the classroom. We saw three students, boys, standing outside the front door of the school. We thought they were going to attack us, so we started running and I went home to Shyorongi. What happened after that at the school, I don’t know, I had already left. I arrived home before Dad and when he came home, he asked me what had happened. I told him the whole story and he started to worry about the others [Jeanne d’Arc’s brothers and sisters] as well. One was studying at the Butare Groupe Scolaire, another one was studying in Rwamagana. He said he had learned that the same thing had happened the day before in Rwamagana and he wondered why they hadn’t come home yet. He feared they’d been killed. I only went back [to the school] much later to get my things. When we got there, we were prevented from entering and we were told that all the students who had gone home had to wait to be called for a meeting and that we could all go back to school at the same time. In fact, no one, even among the other students, knew what had really happened at the school. It appears that there were people who wanted to attack the school and that the nuns knew that beforehand and they told the students to go home. Nothing happened to anyone, unless something else was going on during the night.After a while. It was a long time before the schools opened again. When my high school reopened, they only accepted a few people per class. In fact, they didn’t take back the same number of Tutsis, some Tutsis had to start the application process all over again, so some went to other schools.They were killed during the genocide of the Tutsis in 1994. They died, my father too. My father was killed in his home in Nyamweru, in the Shyorongi sector. They killed him along with his eldest daughter, who had come a few days before because she lived in Gitarama. As for my mother, she had passed away eight months prior. She didn’t die during the genocide. My brothers died while they were en route. In fact, a large majority of the family perished in the area between Nyanza and Butare. They were all put in a septic tank in the house of the Nyanza nuns, because one of our aunts who was a nun lived there. My brother, his wife, their children, and the wife of my other brother—he had died previously—with her five children, had all fled to her [the nun’s] home. We were also going there, but we were lucky that we couldn’t find a way to get to her house, otherwise we would be with them in that hole. So my brother, my two sisters-in-law and eight children lost their lives there. As for our house, those who lost their lives there were my father and my older sister—whose children were lucky to survive—and many other people who were at home. My little sister and I, we took the same road to find refuge, but we didn’t hide in the same place and it was only after the genocide that I found out she was still alive. I was in Bugesera when a soldier told me that she was working in the hospital and that she had given birth, because she was pregnant during the genocide. I asked the soldier if he could call her so that I could make sure that it really was her, because neither of us knew we were both alive. That’s how we found each other, and she now lives in Kigali.There are two that we haven’t been able to find: François Kambanda and his wife, Odette Kamanzi. We couldn’t find them, but they died in the area between Nyanza and Butare. We looked for them everywhere. I thought that they must be in the memorial sites somewhere, because people were brought to these sites from wherever they happened to be killed and were placed in funerary monuments so they could be buried in peace. So I think they must be there too, as they are the only ones whose place of death we weren’t able to find.They don’t avoid me. They come to greet me as if nothing has happened. I was looking at them and was wondering what was the purpose of all this for them. I said to one person that they all used to live in peace in this region and that they’ve killed all the others and that I find that it didn’t serve them any purpose—on the contrary, they didn’t seem to be doing well. He then began telling me that it wasn’t him who had killed them, but so and so had done it, but he was naming people that didn’t exist or that I couldn’t identify. So given all this, I don’t know what to say to them anymore; you can only look at them and you can’t find appropriate words. When you’re there, you feel completely confounded.I really don’t know how one manages to live. It is a miracle from God because after all this, you feel as if you are nothing, you have the impression that your life is for nothing. For me, I got strength from seeing my friends who had lost their children or husbands, and were all alone. It made me realize that I was luckier than them, because I have lost family members, but they had as well, in addition to their children. They are all alone, but when you look at them, they seem strong. These are the things that give you the strength to continue living. But that doesn’t prevent an enduring sense of crisis: every little thing reminds you that you no longer have brothers or sisters and that you are an orphan. Even though we are older now and being an orphan might be easier to bear, we also feel we need our parents. We might have had more luck, but it doesn’t mean that life isn’t difficult sometimes and that’s what we say in Kinyarwanda: one parent consoles the other. When you are sad, you think of the other person who has lost everything and you say to yourself that if the other can continue, how can you give up? As for the children, we always try to remind them of their cousins \\u200b\\u200bby asking them, for example, “Do you remember Olive?” Olive was their cousin, she was a year and a half or two years older than my daughter, but they grew up together and they were friends. I often remind her of Olive, asking her if she has any idea how old Olive, Marie-Ange’s sister, would be now. I also remind them of Olive’s big brother. I see that they understand and they remain strong, but I can’t talk about it without crying because to me these are people we can’t forget. We can’t forget, we are saddened, but we just have to keep our faith in God and continue living.You have to explain to them because these are not things to be silent about. I think it’s good to explain to them what happened, and how people were senselessly killed so that they grow up knowing what a genocide is, and what caused it, so they don’t minimize its impact and so that they too can explain it to others. You can also direct them to documentation centres where they can find a lot of information to read, and you can ask them to do research on the topic so that the genocide doesn’t happen again because everyone would know what it is and everyone would help to fight against it.There is something that my mother told me when political parties such as the LP [Liberal Party] and the RDM [Republican Democratic Movement] were created in Kigali, and many people were going into politics, she told us, “My children, you’ll see what the parties are going to lead to, they’re going to kill people.” She told us about what had happened long time ago with the creation of political parties such as Runari [Unar], Raderi [Rader] and others like them. She told us that it was these parties that provoked the war, and that’s how she knew that the creation of parties leads to war. She was telling us all of this as lived history. So, what I mean is that these were the early warning signs such as the creation of political parties like the Interahamwe and the conflicts between opposition parties. It was also rumoured that in some places, people were throwing rocks at the houses every night for no reason, people were killing each other, the Interahamwe were killing people, people attacked Gikondo and it was at that time that Katumba died. All this gave us an idea of \\u200b\\u200bwhat was to come, it was clear that these killings would not be limited to Gikondo or other places, that they would spread everywhere.I believe that everyone who survived the genocide did so because there was someone who had helped them hide. Some wanted to hide people and others didn’t. There are also those who could do it and those who couldn’t. It depended on the status of the person: if it was an influential individual, he could hide people in his home and no one was going to attack him at home, if no one knew they were hiding people there, of course, it had to be done in secret. Very few people were able to do that. If everyone had a good heart, and each person had hidden ten Tutsis, whole families wouldn’t have been extinguished. It didn’t happen because there was little will.It’s a very difficult thing to do, because it’s a difficult life. Little by little, you learn how to start a new life. Integration takes many years before you start feeling that you are where you are supposed to be, even though sometimes you don’t feel that you have fully integrated. And you force yourself because you know you can’t go back. In spite of the difficult things that you’ve lived through in Rwanda, when you arrive here, you realize that you don’t know how you’re going to manage and sometimes you think you won’t be able to do it. But step by step, you integrate and you meet other people who help you.When we arrived here, we knew a few Rwandans who helped us in the little time they had because everyone is busy with their lives. Otherwise, to me it seemed that we were received warmly in the country. I like the way things are done here even if sometimes it takes time to obtain certain documents, but at least you don’t feel threatened. We have everything we need to live, the children go to school. The more you integrate, the more beautiful life becomes.There are services specifically for immigrants, I believe that when you arrive at immigration where you declare your status, you are directed to these services. But it’s not the same thing as when you find someone from your own community, because that person can accompany you or give you a piece of paper with an address or a phone number written on it. Some people don’t even know how to use the phones here. These services are useful, but it’s not the same thing as when you find an acquaintance to help you.When we arrived here the children were still little, they continued their schooling, those who were going to primary school continued in primary here and those who were going to high school continued in high school. At that time, our children were not yet at the university level. I didn’t go back to school for at least another five years, but I was working during that time. I was able to integrate easily with the help of the people from the community with whom I was in touch. They referred me to a place where I could do a caregiver training, but I didn’t stay there long. Otherwise, I was at home for most of the time, doing housework and waiting for the kids to come home from school. I went back to study social work for two years. After graduating, I found a job and I’m still working in this field. With time, we establish a routine, because at the beginning it is difficult to combine working and taking care of the home.Here in Canada, I never see people from the other ethnic group, the one that committed the genocide—they keep it to themselves. I don’t meet them on the streets, and I don’t see them even at weddings. To recognize them, one has to talk to every Black person one meets; even at work where I meet people from the same community—I never see them. It’s difficult to answer this question because I never see them.Yes, I’m considering it because I don’t think I will grow old in Canada.As we get older, we reach a point where we can’t take care of ourselves any longer. It’s too [early?] to say, but I think it’s better to grow old in your country of birth.I haven’t had the chance yet to speak to those who have returned, but in my opinion, I think that having to reintegrate can be difficult, I think it takes time.I see the people I’ve been friends with for a long time, and who have remained friends. The people I meet there are friends of the family, people I often talk to on the phone. These are people that when you see them, you feel as though you often spend time together because you have much to say to each other. But what remains a shock is that you don’t see your brothers and sisters coming to welcome you. Your friends are there, but you should be seeing your brothers and sisters. There is always an absence, there are always people missing.There are few community activities that bring us together. Often it is the weddings and funerals that bring us together and in those moments, the topics of conversation depend on the circumstances. Otherwise, the community activities that bring us together are rare, except perhaps sharing a meal with the children at Christmas time, but there aren’t many other events.I think what happened in Rwanda has been commercialized, the genocide has been commercialized, and people found a way to make a movie out of it—to be seen and bought by the greatest number of people. But they didn’t approach the people who have lived through the genocide asking them to star in the film. They use their own means, and that’s why I say that it seems commercialized to me, because the people who star in these films only imitate, while those who have lived through it are still around… I don’t know if that answers your question.I think that those who lived through it can play these roles, because they can bring out their emotions, while others would only imitate, it would be like a game for them. It depends on how a person is: some would have the strength to do so and others wouldn’t be able to because of what they have experienced.I could play scenes from my own experience, but I don’t think I can play for example what happened at the Hôtel des mille collines since I wasn’t there. But I could play what happened while I was following my own path because I haven’t forgotten anything.I find that each person still bears a lot of sadness, they feel that they have been victimized, and sometimes they say that they aren’t able to return home, because that’s where those who have killed their families still live, because those who have gone to prison are now free, and the survivors feel as though they, who have experienced this misfortune, are no longer relevant. There is a wound that isn’t healing and that still hurts.I think that the gacaca represent the survivors, because they revealed who had killed whom and in the different regions. What I didn’t appreciate were the convictions, I find that they don’t measure up to the deaths of our families. The killers are given a short sentence and in a short time they find themselves free. I personally asked one of them—I had heard that he had been imprisoned and then freed—and he told me that he was given a short sentence of 13 years only, and he had done his time. When listening to his answer, you realize that he himself is aware that his sentence doesn’t match his crime. That’s what I’m referring to when I talk about the wound that still hurts.I never had the opportunity to go, but I know people who have gone and who came back rather depressed. It’s depressing, especially because they tell you about the death of your parent, saying, for example, that he was struck by so and so with a hammer or a knife, and that’s what they talk about at the gacaca, and whoever goes there and hears about the death of their relatives, comes back sick. I think hearing this hurts even more and it’s better not to hear anything. Normally, criminals are punished. I think that what can help us is to find people to talk to about it on a regular basis so that you don’t always keep it in your heart and don’t remain sad, even if the sadness will never completely go away, but it’s still worth talking with those who have also had the experience or those who are interested in hearing about it. Through discussions, the genocide remains an important topic, and I think that’s all we can do for our departed ones, and nothing else.I think we talked about almost everything, even though we didn’t have time to expand on some topics. The message I would like to send is to say that it is good to discuss this together so that we always remember—because we couldn’t write a book. It would be good if you could talk with everyone else so that we continue talking about our genocide, because it’s us and no one else who will keep the topic open. I say it’s “our genocide” because we are the ones who have suffered.I would explain to them the genocide and what happened to us, because most of them ask us anyways about what caused it. So we have to take the time to explain who the genocide perpetrators are so that Canadians are not left with the impression that all Rwandans were perpetrators. They might meet a person from the other group and after hearing their perspective Canadians might think that the genocide perpetrators were the Tutsis. So we have to find the time to explain the causes of the genocide, its inception and who were the people who were killed.Oh my god, she was a woman of character; she was like a man, actually.Actually, they had a very close relationship. I remember once my grandmother said: “This house, it is my daughter who built it for me.” She said a lot of nice things about my mother. She would say, “Your mother was a smart, hard-working girl.” She was very proud of her daughter, maybe because my mother had studied, I don’t know… My mother had—well, during that time it was relatively difficult—she finished her studies during the time of the Revolution and all that, and then she was forced to flee her home.No, my mother. She was forced to flee, but we didn’t talk about that very much in the family. Once my grandmother said that there were people who helped my mother hide, ku rusenge—do you know what urusenge is?—to leave the region. I always had the impression that she wasn’t very pleased to think back to that period—my mother never told me about it.Tutsi children who—since we didn’t really have the chance to go to high school, my parents had to falsify [laughter] my identity and I became somebody else…Well, my parents…, they were both teachers…—and at that time having three children was not many. My mother suffered that—I think my mother was very sad for not having many children. It wasn’t a choice, it just happened that way. So my mother, she would have—my mother loved children so much that she would have loved to have ten kids. [laughter] There were often children who stopped by our house, who came to get something to eat, who would spend a week [with us]. There was also—we had adopted a little boy, he was one of our neighbours whose parents were very, very poor and his father had passed away. He came to our home and he stayed with us; he was killed during the genocide. That’s it, that’s all I can say. My parents were hard-working people, discreet, very discreet, and proud, very proud too. I remember, people in our region were saying that we were rich. [laughter] They believed—they thought—they would say, “Oh, they are rich!” while other families were in a situation similar to ours. There were many couples where both partners were working, but I don’t know why people were saying that we were rich. We could study without a problem, go to high school without a problem—when I say “without a problem” I mean without financial problems. Yeah.Yes. Well, we had a normal relationship, like any brothers-sisters relationship. We had fights sometimes and at other times there were moments of affection, of trust; but above all, we had a strong bond. Yes, a strong connection.With the youngest, the one who died. Maybe because he was younger and I felt I should protect him. [laughter] Yes, that’s it. With my brother who was born right after me, it was like we were the same age, so we challenged each other often and at the same time we were very close, we confided little secrets to each other. But my youngest brother… Frankly, when I think that he was killed in that way, it’s hard to accept, to understand. And it’s also because of his character that I am very sad, very, very sad [to have lost him] because he was such a sweet child, very, very sweet, very nice.My father and my mother were actually born the same year, 1939.It was like in all patriarchal societies: the mother stays at home—well, my mother didn’t really stay at home, but she was there, she worked both outside and inside the home at the same time, so she was pretty much always there. My father was authoritative, we feared, respected him a lot. And my mother used that to threaten us: she would say, “I’ll tell your father when he comes back, you’ll see.” So it was like he was an authority figure, but ultimately—pardon me [blows nose]—in the end, mother was the boss. [laughter] Yes. But in my memory, in fact, my father was the more lenient one, and I understand him—My memory is of—[laughter] it was like a little corner of paradise, now that I think of it, it was like a little corner… It was the countryside, we lived in the countryside. We would have liked to live in the city, in Kigali, when we were young, to be city dwellers, but now that I think of it, I think we were privileged to live close to nature, to live surrounded by so much beauty: the mountains, the greenery, the space, especially the space we had, we played outside all day, we ran—No, as children we were carefree, we played, we shouted, we ran in the bush, we herded the cows, the calves, kuragira, twaragiraga inyana in the evenings. When I think about it now, I think we had a happy childhood, after all.No, not anywhere, oh no, no, not anywhere, but our neighbours—we had no problems with our next-door neighbours. Well, my aunt lived 500 meters from our house, so we played with my cousins \\u200b\\u200band with other kids from the neighbourhood. But we didn’t go very far, we stayed close to home. Yes.[laughter] What do you think?You as well? You found out later?It meant a woman with a strong character, an active woman, [laughter] who seems to be everywhere at the same time [shows with a gesture], and I too seemed to be quite active.Yes, but indirectly. At the beginning of every term, one of the teachers—and that is something that has marked me—would say to us, “All abahutu, abahutu hano, stand on this side and all abanari, on the other side.” [shows with gestures]Now that I think about it, I wonder how did these children——because 8-year-old children, 7–8 year-old—if you weren’t in this group, you had to be in the other. But I knew I was umwega, and I had a bit of doubt.No, no, he didn’t mention abega, but I was unsure, I thought to myself, “Should I go there [shows with gestures] towards the Hutu group, or there [gestures] to the abanari group?” And while I [inaudible] he said to me, “You, you go there, [gestures] to the abanari group.” [takes a tissue from a box nearby]Yes, in primary school. The other teachers were good. In 1st grade I had a very kind teacher, a neighbour; in 3rd grade, another very nice gentleman; in 4th it was my father—in fact, when—[laughter]—in 5th, another very nice gentleman. Actually, things were good in primary school.I had eight, actually nine, because I did my 6th grade—I don’t know how many—I did my 6th grade three times. I would do 6th grade and then I would repeat it, I had to repeat it because I failed to pass the exam. Actually, I passed it, but I wasn’t selected, it was the famous equilibrium policy and all that. So what could I do?—uh, that’s when I was accepted to a high school, and that wasn’t easy either even though I was first in my class.Well, my father had to pay money—he knew someone who worked at the Ministry of Education, he paid a large sum. My parents worked hard, they had put money aside and all, and he paid a big sum, and then I was accepted into a shabby high school that had just opened in our area, in Mubuga.Initially, it was a three-year high school for, you know, to train teaching assistants, things like that. And later, it was decided that all programs would provide a six-year training, so we spent six years there.Well, yes, I was—yes, I [inaudible] excuse me—I was in the “Normale primaire” stream.Well, in the case of my parents: we had servants who lived in our house. Also, family members often came and went. It wasn’t complicated, it wasn’t very complicated, I don’t think. [laughter] It was alright.Actually, when I finished university—well, I left my parents’ house to go to university—no, no, to start working, to start work in Kibuye as a teacher, in a college in Kibuye.No, no, I lived there. So it was the first time… Actually, the very first time was when I went to boarding school as a high school student. It wasn’t complicated. Then I left to start working, then I went to university in Ruhengeri, in Nyakinama, and then, after the genocide… In fact, after university I started working in Butare, while my father lived in Kigali, so during that time we didn’t live together.Not really.Yes, on the weekends and they also came to see me. Uh, I have to say that I left my parents when I was really young, as I said in the beginning, I was 12 when I went to live with my grandmother. To me that was a terrible shock, even though my grandmother was there, but I had never lived with her before. My aunt was there too, she was a teacher, we lived under the same roof. I had a cousin and a maid, so we were a whole family. Despite all of this, it was still very hard, very, very hard, at 12 years old, it was very difficult because that was another way of life, another environment, it’s—yeah. It was very difficult, but after a while it wasn’t so difficult anymore. So there. But at the same time, I—when I left as an adult, it was a whole new experience living away from my parents—I felt free. [laughter] I said before that my parents were very protective. Had I stayed close to them—[laughter, shakes head saying “no”]—no, no, as an adult, I had to experience that, to live—to take care of my life. Yes. But I also must say that I was used to moving around. I was an athlete, I played volleyball and we travelled often with the team, we played all over the country and outside of the country too, so I had—I loved that experience of—Oh yes, the only girl—what will happen to her? When I was far away from them, I was living a different experience. [laughter]The first year, I lived at home with my parents, I was teaching at the primary school in my region during that first year. And I didn’t know what to do with my money because I had never managed money before. [laughter] I had never had any responsibilities and with a big sum like that—I think it was something like 12,000 Rwandan francs—so I didn’t know what to do with that amount, honestly. I spoiled myself.Oh yes. And my parents didn’t really need me.In 1997, in 1997. At the same time there were children, orphans, people who were really in need, I couldn’t ignore them. And my father had gone to Kigali because we couldn’t live where we were, there was nothing left for us to do in our village, nothing, so we were in Kigali and life had become more expensive. My father was working, he was a teacher, he continued doing that. He was a teacher in Kigali. It wasn’t like before. Orphans stayed with us at our house, so it was tight quarters. But we managed. Space was tight though.What?Uh, 1994, yes, actually, I was in Kigali when it happened.I was 29 years old, I was in Kigali. I had left my—it was Easter break. I had left on a Wednesday morning, very early in the morning, to go to Kigali, I had some shopping to do. I arrived in Kigali around 10 am. I had some contacts—people I was going to meet. Then, in the evening—paff!—they said that the President had just crashed, his plane had just crashed. Just a few hours prior to that, I wouldn’t have believed there could be an accident because the soldiers from the UN mission were there and we had signed peace treaties in Arusha. In my mind it was rather—well, I—in my mind I thought it was—I thought that something good would come out of it, that we would make it through. But when I heard the news—I was with friends of mine, a family—when we learned that apparently the President’s plane was burning, a dark picture emerged right away. To me, it was clear. It was like I could see what was going to happen. And at that moment I was ready, I was ready. I thought that if Habyarimana were killed, it was over. I had been thinking, “Even if he had died from a sickness, we are going to pay.” And this time I thought, “If he’s been killed, it’s over.” There was no doubt in my mind. If I could have left, I would have right away—leave the country, that is—I would have, but I couldn’t. We heard that roadblocks had been set up and we could hear gunshots all night—they had already started killing people. This family and I, we fled to Saint Paul [Centre], near Sainte-Famille, and we stayed there for three months. We arrived on the 7th in the afternoon and we left a few days before they captured Kigali, we were evacuated to Kabuga, in the zone controlled by the RPF. So during that whole time, there was no doubt in my mind that I was the only survivor in my family.Yes, with many people who lived in the neighbourhood or other people who were sent to Saint Paul. There were about 1,000 of us—1,500, I think. And every day we were waiting to be killed. Every morning they would come, the militia, the soldiers, they came to pick people up, they took the young, the men, they killed them downstairs, they shot them downstairs.It’s a pastoral centre. Saint-Paul is right next to Sainte-Famille, so there were—it’s a centre that hosted people, I think, for meetings or retreats, it belonged to the Kigali diocese. There was a priest there who was really great, who—well, he protected us, he did his best not to give us up, he did his best to keep us alive, he interceded with the militia, he would say, “There are no RPF supporters here; these are just poor people who are hiding.” We survived, and then the RPF came to evacuate everyone.I’m telling you, we lived, we survived, I don’t know how, but we survived. It was, precisely, this priest who went every morning to get food, to get some water. For sure, it wasn’t much of a life, it was survival. We could—sometimes, we didn’t eat for days! That wasn’t the problem. The problem—Well, they came with their shining machetes—To Saint Paul—it was April 7, around 3 o’clock. But at that time things weren’t clear yet. I—we were very scared, things weren’t clear yet. We got there, we were [sleeping on] bedspreads—pff—we were living in fear and the children were crying, we didn’t want to hear them cry—pff—it was scary, it really was. We were very, very scared.I left it to go to the Hôtel des Mille Collines because I was injured. [points to her shoulder] I was shot in the shoulder and had an infection and I wasn’t feeling well. I was very sick. One of the soldiers from the FAR, the Armed Forces—Yes, he had remained a human being. He knew all kinds of information such as that they were going to kill everyone there. He asked a friend of mine if or what he could do for her—although he didn’t really have power, he was only a subordinate. And my friend said, “Can you transport us to the Hôtel des Mille Collines?” because we had heard that—we had learned that they had water there. [laughter]And then he asked me, “Do you want to go to the Hôtel des Mille Collines?” Well, I didn’t know anymore—I didn’t know what I—I couldn’t think straight. I said, “Okay, let’s go.” We got into his car and we drove to the Hôtel des Mille Collines. The next day, the RPF evacuated Saint Paul, where we were. And people later told us that everyone who was at Saint Paul had been massacred—everyone. All of them.No, no. We were driving by the posts of the Presidential Guard. Pff—I thought to myself: Is there anything more ridiculous than this situation? I didn’t understand anything anymore. A few days before, we couldn’t even look out the window, and now we are driving past them—Yes, they knew we were going there and they were saying—the militiamen were saying, “Tell Kagame that we will meet him one day.” [laughter] And then—throughout this whole journey I was praying; I couldn’t believe it—I couldn’t believe it… I was praying and I was thinking that if we died, at least I’d be ready for that. [laughter] Then, suddenly, I saw the RPF soldiers and—ah, things shifted in my mind and it was strange to think we were safe. And that’s when I started to cry.[Nods] That’s when I started to cry, realizing that I was going to survive and being mad at myself—it’s weird, huh? I was angry at myself to have survived. I started to get mad at myself, seriously, I didn’t want to live anymore. I was either thinking about all the people who had died or I was mad at myself to still be alive. It lasted for some time, this feeling. I hated myself. I didn’t love myself at all, I hated myself. It seemed I didn’t want to survive. Finally, I grasped that it was all real—I was really there. It’s as if I had betrayed my people, I had betrayed them and that was the reality, it wasn’t a dream, no. But during all that time when we were in Kabuga—that’s a suburb of Kigali—I wasn’t doing well. No, I wasn’t doing well at all. I was confused, really, I was—I was confused. I was seeing people getting back to their lives, regaining the desire to live, but I was—I felt guilty about that too. I said to myself, “Why am I not like the others? Why am I not happy?” I wasn’t happy to have survived, I felt guilty. I thought, “I’m not normal, I’m not—” [is thinking about the word]—that I’m not grateful. I felt angry at myself and at the same time I was thinking, “Why should I be grateful? Why did you live, why did you survive?” It was confusing.Also, my wound was infected, I wasn’t doing well at all, I thought I had malaria too. Yes, I looked at myself and I didn’t love myself at all. I was like a—I was like dead or as if I was in a dream, in a nightmare and I didn’t want to wake up. I—then—when we were in Kabuga, I could see people getting furniture, getting the things they needed to carry on with their lives—there were abandoned things, abandoned houses, stuff left on the side of the road, and everything. It was as if people wanted to get out of—Honestly, he gave me money, but I—no, I refused, I said I didn’t need it. “Do you need any clothes?” I said no. [shakes head] I said I didn’t need anything. I was just there, in the present moment, the way I was—I wasn’t thinking about how I was going to live tomorrow, I wasn’t thinking about that.Do you know what happened to me afterwards? Oblivion, amnesia. I can’t tell you how long we stayed in Kabuga, I can’t tell you when we left for Kabuga and on what date we left Kabuga—no. When I think about it, it’s like a single day that is being drawn out. I completely lost the notion of time. That may have helped me survive, but my capacity to remember was blocked.No, no, it was like my spine broke in half, I was unable to stand upright. I sat on the asphalt, I started crying [laughter] and I said, “No it’s not my father, it’s my brother you’ve seen.” The youngest one that was killed. I said, “No, I don’t want to hear you say that. I don’t want my father, I want my brother.” [laughter][Shakes head] No, he was alone. He was alone. And, oddly enough, like me, he had also learned just two days before that I was alive. A woman from Saint Paul who—I don’t know how—she went back to her region, looking for members of her family, I think, and she recognized my father and told him, “Your daughter is alive.” My father had the same—he had the same reaction as me: he told me it was like he heard something blowing on his face and then he lost consciousness. I went to look for him. I couldn’t recognize him at first and he couldn’t recognize me, we had changed so much.Actually, I learned that my mother was killed the same day—no, it was April 9. People were starting to flee, the situation was getting more difficult, people were leaving their homes to go to the churches and public places like that, and they were encouraged to go to the churches. My mother was getting ready to go to the church as well and she told my father to go scare the cows away. [laughter]—with the cows and with the herdsman—we had a whole herd, especially the calves, the little ones that had just been born, my father and the herdsman had to carry them on their shoulders and walk to—and my brother, the one who was killed, along with my other adoptive brother, they were also out to see if—they went to the highest place on the hill to observe from there what was going on, and they didn’t come back. They—people were saying, “Hey, you, the fugitives, go quickly, go either to the church or to Bisesero in the high mountains, but don’t come home.” So that’s how they left. And my mother was preparing to leave too. There was a girl who was living—a cousin who was there with my mom and also another girl who was living with us—oh, that girl survived, she was the one who told me the story afterwards. My mother gave her the keys to the house—my mother always had a bundle of keys, and she said, “Take the key, if anyone survives, you will be able to open the door to the house for them.” And, apparently, while she was saying that, she was also praying the Rosary, the girl told me. Then they attacked the house and my mother, my cousin, and this girl, they ran out, in the other—in the opposite direction. But the killers ran after them. And there was a man on the hill on the opposite side who told the killers, “That’s where they are, go through there, go through there!”And a few meters away they slaughtered them with a machete, my mother and my cousin. This other girl, she went—she hid with a Hutu family. What else was I going to say? Then they went to our house and they took absolutely everything, everything: the doors, the windows. What they didn’t take was the cement that covered the floor, that’s the only thing they couldn’t take. So that’s it, they took it all. They thought that even the old pot was worth something or that an old basket had some value. Apparently, they took everything. There was a jerrycan filled with gas because we didn’t have electricity in the village, we used candles to light the rooms in the house, and my mother was buying large quantities of gas. They came across that and they were convinced that the gas was to be used to burn Hutus. Then they waited for my father, they went to look for him and for my two brothers. And my father, after hiding the cows, wanted to go back, but people said, “Don’t go home, they’re waiting, they’re waiting for you. Your wife, the children who were there—finished, your house—forget about it.” So my father remained in Bisesero, on the hills of Bisesero. So that’s the story I was told.Oh yes. There are things, events we didn’t talk about, but that were, like, in—in—not in continuity, but in—that were in keeping with—which pointed to the same direction. As I told you, when I was 7–8 years old and we were made to stand up and were told “abanari hano, abahutu hano,” that was—it’s not normal to talk to children like that. And it’s not normal to indicate one’s ethnicity in—why was the ethnicity written on the identity cards? Or in a child’s personal file at school, from the age of 6, 1st grade? That indication was something that followed you throughout your life. So that’s not normal—that’s what I say is not normal. They knew what they were doing. I didn’t experience the events during the years of the Revolution, my parents lived through that, but we lived in the continuation of what had been started. For example, the information in these personal files followed you until you got your identity card where it was clearly stated that you were Hutu or Tutsi or Twa, but it also prevented us from continuing our studies. That was—that’s the real genocide. Preventing someone from studying is like killing that person, they are already dead. I think that was also part of the genocide; the genocide wasn’t only the outcome, it was [a process that was] already there, it had already begun. It was a very frustrating thing to do, preventing children from studying when they have the abilities; preventing people from having access to services, to jobs, preventing people from working is—it was—I think it was a continuation of what had started before. In fact, it had never stopped. Some people won’t believe it if you tell them that it had never stopped, but I know it, I feel it—it had always been this way. We were scrutinized: whether you had access to high school, what you were going to learn in high school, which section you were enrolled in in high school—everything was monitored. Going to university was almost unthinkable. There was—you had to do a whole lot of maneuvering to be able to access university studies. It was difficult, it wasn’t easy at all, everything was observed, it was—things were doled out to us until—they were aware, I think they knew that at some point they would finish what they had started. Yes.After the genocide, I honestly didn’t feel safe when the RPF took power, but I felt safe when I thought that we weren’t risking death anymore. That’s when I felt like the weight lifted. Unfortunately, we paid for that very dearly. But afterwards I could at least say: “I can walk down the street, I can walk with my head held high, I’m not ashamed of who I am.” I told myself, “I’m more or less safe.” But at the same time the old demons——were constantly coming back, all the time. I could see the consequences [of the genocide], the orphans, and I ended up thinking that I had gotten it wrong. I had—I became scared of the people who were coming out of the prisons. But it is only when I came here that I—a 100 percent—[takes a tissue]—this is another world, but nevertheless, I felt 100 percent safe. Yes.Actually, I would have liked to leave earlier, after I finished high school. There was a sister, a teacher, who admired——a nun who believed very much in my abilities. She believed that I must go to university at any cost. She would say to me, “You are brilliant, you absolutely have to—” But at the same time she knew that—she wasn’t telling me this openly, but she knew it was difficult, she had learned the history of the country, she knew it was very difficult. She even made arrangements for me to come here to study, to go to university here.Yes, but—I had to go to the [Rwandan] Ministry of Education to ask permission, that was the rule because I didn’t have any connections. Everything was monitored so you couldn’t leave the country just like that and go study abroad. I prepared my file, she helped me a lot. I had registered, we put together the file, we filed it with the Ministry of Education and then—there was no response. At one point my father went to the Ministry, I think he wanted to check something in his teacher’s record, and someone there told him—one man spoke to him in a way that was very hurtful to my father; the man said, “It seems that you want to send your daughter to study in Canada?” My father started to—he didn’t know what to say, so he said, “Yes…, no…” And the man said, “But who do you think you are?” My father understood what that meant and when he came back home he said, “Forget it.”No. We were in the same place at the same time. She came to see me and she asked me, “Do you remember your file?” I said, “I remember, I remember…” Yes, but it was afterwards that I got a scholarship, after all, to come and study here.Well, I stayed, yes, I stayed and made a life for myself here, as you can see.Because I arrived here first, I knew Montreal well and that is where I first got my bearings. I made friends in Montreal, you among them. That’s it.Yes, well, the organization that was paying for my studies. And at the university as well, there were people ready to provide information. It was—I thought the way we were welcomed was great. Yes, yes, it was very good. And I had—there were Rwandans I knew who had come before me and we reconnected in Montreal; they welcomed me. They showed me how to take the metro. They let me stay with them in the beginning. They were very, very nice to me. After that I created my own network, a whole network of friends. And that’s it. But it wasn’t easy, it wasn’t—it wasn’t easy at first. It was like I was alone. I was far away from my social network [in Rwanda], a network I had formed after the genocide. The social network I built after the genocide was like—in fact, it was like another life had began. It was like making your first steps: we learn to talk, to walk, to reflect, to think. So I missed very much the people with whom I had started this second life because we had a kind of a symbiotic relationship. We had everything in common. [Coming here] felt like a baby who’d been separated from his mother, a little baby, so it was like—it was almost the same situation [as in Rwanda after the genocide]. We were really vulnerable and helpless after the genocide and with these people we created something new together—how can I explain it?—it’s like we had—like we maintained a symbiotic relationship, we were like that. [makes a gesture with two hands clasped together] We shared a common history, we had everything in common. So when I left that network, that environment, I felt lost. When I arrived here, everything was different, it wasn’t the same, and so I learned again how to live. That’s it.Yes, later on, but not many, a few people, yes.Yes, when we would get together we would talk, and talk, and talk. It’s like—when you see the person who was with—with whom I was at Saint Paul, that person has something more than the others.I met him at the university, he helped me a lot. One of my professors referred me to him, because this professor thought I had problems. He may have detected trauma problems, I don’t know. He told me, “I will refer you to this person, he’ll be able to help you, he’s a very nice guy.” We started meeting, he spent a lot of time with me, he listened to me. He wasn’t just a counsellor—no, no, he was listening to me and a strong connection was created between us. I saw him as a father-figure, as my father, as a great friend. In the darkest days…, just listening to me, asking me a few questions—he let me talk and it helped a lot, it helped me to find brightness in dark days. I could see light again. That’s how it started, the friendship was born like that and then after the friendship came love. And then we got married and had two beautiful children.Yes, a boy and a girl. It’s not always easy [laughter] because I have my African and Rwandan traditions and on the side of their father there is the North American, Quebec, Western education, so it’s not always easy. But at the same time this enriches the children, and we’re already seeing the results. Yes, yes, they are not—they are balanced, intelligent children, who are appreciated—my whole life is greatly appreciated—who know how to live together with others. So, combining the two [cultures] creates something good. At the same time their environment at school, it’s Québécois, it’s not Rwandan—but my influence… As a father he is very present. I am proud of this meeting of two mentalities, of two cultures, which initially don’t have anything in common, but which ultimately complement each other nicely. You only need to see the children’s openness to understand the society in which we live, to understand that they won’t live in the same world in which I’ve lived. Even in Rwanda it has evolved a lot. The world in which I was raised is very different from the one in which the children are raised today. There is a greater openness, so I don’t have to impose my upbringing on my children—no, far from that. We raise our children with the future in mind; we raise them so that they can adapt to this society, adapt to being good to others, helpful, compassionate, sensitive to the problems of others. Yes, that’s it.No, I can’t use my family as an example, because with us it was different. At home I didn’t feel a difference, I didn’t feel that boys were favoured—on the contrary. We had to deserve what we—to expect appreciation, we had to deserve it first. I never felt inferior to the boys because I was proving myself, I was good at school, I had good grades, there was nothing that predisposed me to be inferior to the boys. On the other hand, I’ve seen—for sure, [in Rwanda] boys were more favoured than girls. So if one of the children had to leave school because the parents couldn’t afford it, it was the girl who left school to help her mother. I wasn’t in—I was lucky not to live in such conditions. My parents knew the advantages of going to school, of education, especially since my mother had had the chance to study. They knew that it was very important for girls to study and even to go farther than they have, to live in better conditions. They took it upon themselves—they worked very hard, very, very hard [inaudible] they wanted us to go farther than they had, I could see that. So they wanted me to go to university at all cost, to go to university at all cost. Yes.I think that—Yes, it will be the same thing, we will offer them the best of ourselves, the best possible conditions, as far as possible. So yeah. I see no difference between a boy and a girl, frankly, I don’t see it, no.—and we say, “What’s going on in his little head?” But we’re also not making up stories, we show the children what to do. We talk to them, we must listen to the children. We must listen to them and we must talk to them. It’s true, children do stupid things, adults as well. And in fact, every time a child makes a mistake, it bothers me how we can get carried away, we are ready to punish the child. But I’m thinking to myself: adults do stupid things too, knowing full well that what they’re doing is stupid, and no one is running after them to punish them. So why are we punishing the children, who are weaker? Rather, [we should] try to understand what motivates the child’s behaviour, understand that and then listen to the child. Then everything will be alright. Maybe the behaviour is due to factors in our environment or aspects of our own selves, and when we understand that, we can take measures, we can talk to the child. Well, for now they are still young, [laughter] we aren’t confronted yet with the big problems, they are still very young, we have no problems with them. Yes.Yes. I had to interrupt my doctoral degree when my youngest child was born. I put everything aside, I think it was important to devote myself to my child, and I don’t regret it at all. And soon I intend to pick up from where I left off.Of course, there are many things that change for the better, I find. The country is changing a lot. I have the impression that when we leave a place, we think we will find it again as it was when we left, but that’s not what happens. Our lives are where we are, my life is here. I go back there to see family, friends, but I feel that my life is here even if every day, every day I think about Rwanda. Every day I think about Rwanda. I think about this little country that I love so much. I follow the news from Rwanda, everything that’s going on in the region, I am always up-to-date with the latest news. Rwanda is part of me, with the good and the bad memories, Rwanda is part of me. I follow all the news, I’m interested in everything. At the same time, I love this country too, this welcoming country, I like the people here, I like how open they are, I like their authenticity. Still, we check our history, our past, our education against the culture of our host country. But it’s going well, it’s going very well, we know how to distinguish between the two. Yes.I think about it. [laughter] Yes, I think about it. Listen, when you leave your country at the age of 30, uh, you can’t completely cut the cord. I miss it sometimes: the sun, the hills, the birds… Sometimes I miss it a lot. That doesn’t stop us from functioning well, from living where we are now… But you never know, you never know, I remain open to the idea. I am not torn, though, I don’t feel torn. At the same time, I’m not closing the window to this idea: maybe, why not? Rwanda is still our country [laughter], our little Rwanda. I love our country. Yes, it’s ours, it’s my life.It might happen or it might not. I’m not unhappy here, I feel good here, and when I go back to Rwanda I feel good there too. [laughter] I don’t impose a limit. I know that when I go back to my country I’m welcome there, I’m welcome, I feel good there. And it’s the same when I come back here; I want to come back.Uh, not at all. Some received job offers even before they left here, and they are feeling well there, they are doing well. But apart from that… In any case, if they weren’t doing well, they would have come back. Yes, it’s good to be able to benefit from living in your own country and to be able to apply there your experiences from here, and vice versa. Yes.Taking one’s time—I find that in Rwanda—well, in Africa in general and in Rwanda in particular—taking the time to talk to someone without running around, without feeling rushed, without being in a hurry… Warm personal connection, you know. Also, improvising, so to speak: deciding to go someplace on a whim, without planning. [laughter]It’s not rational; before I even realize that it’s April, I instinctively feel it and I think, “Oh, it’s April.” It’s like it’s programmed [in my mind]. Yes, it’s cyclical. April is a very difficult month. That’s when I start having nightmares, I cry for nothing, I am irritable, in my thoughts, I am with the people who are dead. Yes, that’s April. Right now, I can’t wait for April to come so that we get the commemoration—Yes, yes, yes. I can’t wait for them to grow up. Already my daughter is asking me questions all the time because of my wound—“What happened?” she asks. I tell her I was hurt by the bad guys. I don’t want to lie to her, but I don’t want to say everything either because at her age it’s not good, she can’t understand. So, I just leave it at that. She is beginning to ask questions about her grandparents, about my grandpa, my grandma—on her dad’s side of the family and on mine too. On my side, she at least knows my father, her grandfather, but she asks, “What was my grandmother like? How did she die?” Well, I say, she was killed. “Who killed her?” Ouf, that’s tough. So yes, I can’t wait for her to grow up, to begin to understand. You know, at my daughter’s school, they talked about wars, but at their level of understanding. And her teacher told me that [my daughter] had said in class, “My mother was wounded in the war, she was hurt in the arm.” Yes.Oh yes. Instead of learning it in a—perhaps in an inappropriate way and learning, perhaps, a distorted version of the story, it is better that I speak to her about it, that I present to her my version, my take on the facts: what I’ve seen, what I’ve experienced. Yes, it’s important. I’ll tell her everything—everything! I can’t wait for them to begin to understand so that I can tell it all. I don’t want anything left unclear—it will all be clear! Yes, I will tell them everything.I thank you. You’ve allowed me to open up a little. [laughter]One day—well, I mean, the truth must be told. For sure, it won’t stop lies from flourishing, as they are now, with all the deniers… Still, it is necessary to speak up. There is a gentleman in Kigali who works for an organization in the field of dialogue and peace—they have a way of encouraging people from the two groups to talk to each other. He told me that their theme is umuryango utazimuye urazima. I have a little bit of a cold…Kinyarwanda… There are some terms in Québécois French—I tell Yvon, “Do you know what we say in Kinyarwanda…?” And he says, “That’s exactly it, exactly.” In Kinyarwanda we use a lot of proverbs, action verbs, things like that, to describe certain situations, and he says—[I say], “You know, to summarize all that, we say this, this and this in Kinyarwanda,” and I try to do a proficient translation for him, and he says, “Exactly.”Oh yes, if I come back to live in Montreal, we could collaborate perhaps.You know, I think that proverbs give direct access to a culture: Imigani, ibyo bita gusigura ibirari by’insigamugani. Do you know what “gusigura ibirari by’insigamugani” means? There is a proverb that goes like this: Yaje nk’iya Gatera. [laughter] We learned that in high school, we had to explain where it came from. It’s loaded with meaning and it explains the context of its time.I knew…I knew well my maternal grandmother, I only remember her. I think…I’ve seen my grandfather, but I don’t really remember him.We lived together, but my father…she didn’t live with us for long because this was during those troubled times, between 1959 and the death of my father. She came to live in my father’s house in Nyanza, but at first she was there all by herself, she lived with her daughter, while my father and my mother…my father worked for the government and they didn’t live at home all the time…so I don’t really remember her being there while my dad was also there, but I remember well her being there after my father was killed and when my mother came back. So we always lived with my mother, my grandmother, my aunt…I saw them when I went back home to visit the family. They had very good relations, they worked together, they were very respectful of each other, they lived in the same room and we sometimes had dinner in that room. They had very good relations, very cordial, very respectful.Oh, my. That brings so many emotions since they are both dead. What do I remember? Memories from when I was little… First of all, when I talk about my father…my father died…I was 11-years-old and I think the best gift in my life was to be reassured that I was loved completely. You know, in Rwandan culture, no one says “I love you,” no one comes to you and…well, that’s not how it is said. But my father’s love was unconditional, everyone knew that. And I think it has been very helpful in my life, the feeling that you matter for someone. And so my father was…I was born…I was a girl born after four boys, I had another older sister but she had died, and so for my father it was…I grew up thinking that my name was My Daughter because my father always called me “my daughter” and my father’s friends also called me “my daughter.”  So it really was…I felt I mattered for someone and I knew he was always going to protect me, no one could harm me, no one could…I was spoiled and loved, and I knew it, I was aware of it, everybody knew it, all the people around us. So, the memory I keep…I remember how different my father was with the boys and with me: he was very strict with the boys, very stern, while with me he was very sweet. So I felt super protected and he really was someone who protected me, and I also felt his unconditional love. And…those are the memories I keep. When he died, I think…I didn’t accept it, I didn’t understand it, and I didn’t cry. I’d say that, for me, the period of mourning for my father was when I was preparing for my wedding and that’s when I cried and cried. People talked to me about…when Pierre and I went to see a priest in preparation for the wedding and he asked me, “Are your parents still alive?” I said, “Yes, yes, my mother is,” and he said, “What about your father? What happened to your father?” And I couldn’t tell him. I cried during the whole meeting and Pierre couldn’t understand because I usually told people how my father had died, how he had been killed, but it was a story that…but at that moment, right before the marriage, when you are about to commit to someone…anyway, I don’t know…at that moment when I was grieving his loss, when I was crying for my father, I really felt his absence. So that’s it about my father. My mother…she’s a woman I admire a great deal for how she raised us. She was widowed very young, she wasn’t 40 yet, she had six children: four big boys, me, I was 11, and my sister who was one or two years old—I don’t remember exactly. And she raised us, she educated us, she continued giving us everything we had while my father was alive, education. For sure, the older boys were helping her, but she was a very, very, very disciplined person, you know, she was very much like “that’s how it must be done,” so you had to follow the rules. She was very strict, very strict, especially with me, I thought. What she was thinking, I believe, was: “She’s a girl, she must be well-educated so that she may find a good husband”—or I don’t know. I thought she was very, very strict with me. And when she…I always remember what she told us—in Kinyarwanda we say “the children of a single woman, abana b’umugore,” which means that “you are lacking discipline, you are lacking the presence of a father.” I remember very well her saying, “I don’t want people to think that you are the children of a single mother.” So she was both a dad and a mom. And even though when I was young I thought she was very strict, I am…I was very proud of her and I had the chance to tell her that before she died— —she was in Montreal—that had she not been so hard on us, maybe we wouldn’t have…we wouldn’t be where we are now, we wouldn’t have worked as hard as we did. So that’s it. She always told me, “You know, you’ll have your own children one day and we’ll see how you’ll deal with it.” And I did understand that with children…having children is not easy. I understood it, even if I thought she was strict with us when I was young. But I think that I have taken many qualities from her, I think I am strict too. That’s it. We don’t necessarily like to see ourselves…when I think about how I thought she was strict and I didn’t like that, and now I say to myself, “Oops, I am strict as well and my kids probably think that way about me too.” Sometimes it’s like…well, anyways. So those are my memories of them: they were people who worked a lot, who left us too soon, that’s all.No, the boys were at Groupe scolaire in Butare and I was in Nyanza. I changed schools many times, but we always saw each other during the school holidays. What I remember from my youth is, I think, how angry I was when I was young until I understood feminism. I was really outraged because I realized how unequal we were. As the youngest one, I had to serve those who were older. I was angry when I was young, every morning I was furious. I was angry because I didn’t like waiting on the boys. For them it was like, “Yes, bring us tea, brings us this and that.” I made their beds, I swept the floors, I cleaned the house, while my brothers had the right to sit and read. I was lucky that André was there, but in general I didn’t like them very much. But it wasn’t even them who made demands, it was my mother, and if I refused, she would say, “If you don’t want to do this, I will.” I couldn’t let my mother waiting on my brothers. My sister and I, we don’t have a close relationship. We have an age difference of 9-10 years. I was at the boarding school…it was nice to have…I remember when she was born, I was already grown. It was cute: you have a little doll, you dance for her, I liked taking care of her like that. But then we were separated because I went to boarding school in Butare, Nyanza, and I’m not sure where she was, I don’t remember. She left shortly before 1973, because she really…us, we could study without…they were preventing the Tutsis from continuing [their studies], but that didn’t affect us or at least not as much at the time, but my sister, when she finished primary school, she couldn’t continue studying, so she had to go to a private school. It really was the…you know that the Tutsis didn’t have the right to go to school…she left school, she stopped going to school here, she was too young when she left, and she went to high school in Congo. But then we all left. I was in Canada, she was in Germany. Actually, we reconnected when they came to Canada and I was already married by then, I had my children. With my sister, I would say that we are closer now, but I didn’t really know her before. I felt closer to the boys than to her and she isn’t someone I understand easily. She was sick the last time I was in Montreal, and I think that brought us closer together, and she saw that I was there for her, I spent a lot of time with her and we talked about all kinds of things. But otherwise I would say that our relationship before was rather superficial. I remained the big sister in the family, as the eldest girl, after my mother’s death, I think, at one point I was the link between my brothers, the family and all that. I was bringing them all together, it was me who invited them often, so it was maybe around that time that she and I grew closer together. Otherwise, it was still…I can’t say that I know well who she is or that we’re good friends; we laugh together, but we haven’t spent much time together, so [I can’t say that] she is a good friend.Yes, I went to many boarding schools. I think I was very happy as a child. Apparently, I was a rowdy child, everyone remembers me, even here, when I return to Rwanda, all the people I was in primary school with. I ask them, “But how come you remember me?” And they say, “You were rambunctious, you were always laughing.” I think I had a lot of fun in school because all I did at home was to work. I remember I laughed a lot, I liked to…actually, I don’t remember much…I seem to have a serious case of not remembering too much. But I do remember the nuns. The nuns weren’t nice; I remember they would hit us every Wednesday afternoon, I don’t know why, to warn us or to…I don’t know. I don’t know, I didn’t like it, I was afraid of people who hit me, and yet we were hit often. Those are some of my memories. I went to Mass…we were obliged to go, but it was a kind of an outing. Those were my years in primary school. I had good friends, I remember two or three good friends who now…I also remember when we would talk about Hutus, Tutsis, I remember we were in Nyanza, and every Wednesday afternoon—or very often, anyway, I don’t remember if it was every Wednesday—we went to Rukari where the King lived and we saw the Queen, and we danced for her. We were little girls, so we went…she liked children and I remember that we danced for her. I don’t remember if it was around that time that when I would hear the word “Tutsi,” I thought of the Queen. She was always sitting down, very quiet, her hair in the Rwandan style, she always stood like that, she would look at us, very dignified and very beautiful, and for me being a Tutsi was that, it was her, Queen Rosalie Gicanda. That’s what being a Tutsi meant to me. So when they started telling us that we were Tutsi, I would say, “No, we’re not.” I went to my mother and said, “They asked us if we were Hutu or Tutsi. But we are not Tutsi!” She said, “Why do you say that?” “Because I know the Tutsi, they’re like Queen Rosalie Gicanda.” To this, my mother didn’t say anything, she didn’t say yes or no. But to me, that’s what the image of the Tutsis was—it was that lady. I don’t think I had seen the King, maybe he had already died by then…in any case, I didn’t see him. But that’s what being a Tutsi meant to me. So when we were told “You are Tutsi”—how can we be Tutsi? That’s what I remember from primary school. Then, in high school—I went to Save, to Byimana and I graduated from the Lycée in Kigali—the memories, those were good years. Of course, I started high school after my father’s death, but…when I was in primary school I had seen houses burning, so we knew that those weren’t peaceful times we lived in, but I wasn’t really interested in that, I wasn’t asking myself too many questions. The last time I saw my father…he had come during his vacation to the house in Nyanza, which he had finished working on, and then they attacked them. My mother, my grandmother, my aunt and him came to my school, they took refuge there. In the morning, my father greeted me and then he left—that was the last time I saw him. But my mother and my grandmother stayed at the school for a week. I thought that was a good thing, I didn’t realize that our house had been destroyed, that they were there as refugees. I was glad that I was with my mother, my grandmother and my aunt and that I had seen my father. And that was all.No, they took refuge there because they lived not very far, about eight kilometers away, so they came from our house on foot, they sought refuge there. There weren’t other parents there, I was the only one whose whole family was there. And I remember…it’s funny—actually, it’s not funny—but I remember that the day my father died—he was killed on March 27—that day, after school, we were told to go sweep outside in the yard—I was there that day and I took a piece of wood, I remember very well, I dug a hole, I drew a cross next to it and I wrote “Pierre Claver,” that was my father’s name. And that’s the day he died. It was only after that I realized this, but back then everyone asked me, “But what are you doing!?” It was a joke, but it was a hole, a cross and my father’s name written around it. And since he was killed in Byumba, the nuns learned about it, I think, two or three days later, and all the children were shocked because the nuns were saying, “Do you remember that she dug a hole and wrote her father’s name?” And the nuns came to see me and told me, “Your father is dead,” “That’s not possible”—I didn’t want to understand, and they also said, “Go to the church and pray.” I got scared when they said that. It was six o’clock in the evening, the night was falling, and I was afraid of the dark. And they told me to go to a dark chapel, they had just told me that my father had died—I wasn’t thinking about my father at all—I thought they had made that up, I was just scared, I was thinking, “My God, make them take me out of this pitch-black chapel.” They really showed a lack of sensitivity to tell…to say…to announce a person’s death like that. I lived in denial after that. And when I went to high school I was liked by the older students, they took care of me… I was very happy at the boarding school, and after that I graduated in Kigali. Those were great years, the teenage years, when you have your first crushes and you love the very idea of love… So I finished school in Kigali in 1969 and the next step was going to university. I wanted to go to university, I wanted to study economics. My brother Aimable absolutely wanted me to study physiotherapy—I didn’t even know what that was, it didn’t exist in Rwanda, so there was little chance of me going into that [field]. A nursing school, created by Canadians, had just opened at the time and nobody had applied. So they sent us there, I think there were six of us, and that’s how…I never dreamed of becoming or liked being a nurse, a doctor, it wasn’t tempting to me at all, but they said, “You’re going to nursing school.” It had just opened, it was the first such school at a university level and I said, “No, I can’t look at blood, I can’t.” So Aimable came to see me and said, “You are 18, you can choose: either you start teaching—but do you really see yourself teaching at 18?—or you go into nursing. It’s an opportunity, you’ll be in school, you never know.” So I again listened to him, I did the program and I graduated in 1972, it was…at that point, I was an adult, I was 21 years old. André was going out a lot with [the people from] Volontaires du progress [Association] and I was going out too. I was going out even if it was an unusual thing to do, but I was going out, because my brothers were there.Yes, André and Bello were in Kigali, they were working in Kigali; Émile had gone to Kinshasa and after he left Kinshasa, he went to Belgium, he hadn’t come back yet, he came back much later, when we left; Aimable was in Germany, so there was…and Assumpta was in Congo. There was me and my two brothers, they came to see me in Butare, at the university, and we would go out together. Those were good years, years of freedom. At the same time, I knew how to be a good girl in front of my mother. I was wearing mini-skirts, but before going home, I would put on a pagne so that Mom wouldn’t see me. And I was studying, I wasn’t very interested in it, it wasn’t really something I liked, I was scared a little bit watching women giving birth, stuff like that, but I did it, I studied, I graduated and after I graduated, I immediately got a job at the Butare University Hospital—except that I never got paid. So I had a job, I graduated in, I think, July and I had to start working in August. We could feel—because events were happening in Burundi—we could feel that Rwanda wasn’t very safe, but we were young, we continued having fun. And then in February, that’s when it all really began in Rwanda. We were told, “We don’t want any Tutsi,” and the young people were the ones targeted. So, you would be going to work…I was on my way to the hospital and there, on a tree trunk, a list of names [was posted]: “You are no longer wanted here”—and I saw my name. I went home after that. The same thing had happened to my brothers. In Butare, my brother André was working for Phillips, a private firm, and they had sent him away. My brother Bello was working at the ministry, and he had been sent away too. I wasn’t far from my house, so I went straight home and Mom was extremely worried. She was saying, “No, no, they already killed my husband, I saw it, they killed him before my eyes, I don’t want my children to be killed too. If you can leave, do it.” And we were saying, “Mom, we can’t leave you.” She was saying, “No, no, go, I can’t…I don’t want to witness…” I don’t remember if I went to Kigali…yes, she must have told me to go join my brothers…so I went to Kigali. We tried to flee Kigali, we went to Gisenyi to try crossing the border over to Goma, but someone was following us…we realized that we really were…the man who was following us was Hutu, and so we turned back…our friends from France were with us—we turned back and that same night, we decided to try our luck again, this time crossing over from Bukavu. One of the Frenchmen drove us there, and we made a stop on the way. André and I were in the car, Bello had decided to stay in Kigali; he had said, “You go ahead, I want to see what’s going on and I will join you later.” So we stopped in Nyanza to say goodbye to Mom, and then we continued to Butare, we passed through Nyungwe. André knew people…I remember we arrived at 4 o’clock in the morning at the house of this man—whom I knew, by the way, I even saw him again when I came back here—so that’s what I remember, we arrived at 4 o’clock in the morning, we stayed at this house and we weren’t supposed to go out because we didn’t want others to see us there, to see that people were starting to flee towards Congo. We parked our car at a good distance, we were locked in this house, and the man went to look for smugglers who could bring us to the other side the following night. So we stayed in the house, they brought a bucket and we peed in the bucket inside the house because we couldn’t let people see us trying to flee. We stayed there all day, all night and I think it was in the middle of the night, around three in the morning, when they came to pick us up. They brought us to the river and there were canoes there to help us cross. When we crossed to the other side, André had money and he had given me money—a little bit of money, we had to share it—he had given me a little bit of money to put in my bra, in my underwear so that it wouldn’t be found, and he started to negotiate with the smugglers, he said, “I’m bringing my sister to Zaire for her studies, we must leave right away because a car is waiting for us on the other side.” And they were negotiating with him: “How much will you give us?” There was this one person there—I remember, I stood behind—he came up to us and said, “Hey, what is it that you’re saying?” And André said, “Oh, damn…” and the guy took out a whistle [she whistles] and people started descending towards us from the hills. André said to me, “Hide!”—this was happening during the night—“Hide, because they can catch us and hurt us.” I said, “But André, where do you want me to hide?” We were at the water’s edge. “Jya mubyatsi, mu gihuru: Go into the bushes.” I said, “I can’t go because I’m afraid of snakes.” He said, “Don’t be stupid.” But that was my biggest phobia. “All these people are coming at us with machetes and you’re scared of snakes?” Until that moment, I had never thought that someone might be killed. We were told to leave and we left, but I wasn’t understanding the situation very well. But at that moment I understood, because they approached us and said, “No, no, you are Tutsi, you want to escape.” André was saying, “No, I’m taking my sister there for her studies.” He started to negotiate: “How much do you want?” And he gave the money—I don’t know how much—and after that they said, “Okay, you can go.” I hadn’t gone to hide in the forest and the worst was yet to come. I was shaking, I was really afraid, I felt that our lives were in danger, I was trembling. I got into one of the canoes—it was really a canoe, it was awful, I had never been in a canoe before and now I was in one, I was trembling and I didn’t know how to swim. André told me, “Stop trembling, we’re going to drown.” “But André, do you think I’m doing it on purpose?” “Stop!” And he was holding me like this. We got into the canoe, we crossed the river and we arrived on the other side. There was a hill there that we had to climb to go to Congo. We were almost there, but…and then we saw another canoe approaching with soldiers on board, and we kept climbing. I guess we were saying our prayers because we thought, “If they shoot at us…,” we were unprotected, we were climbing like that—but we were on the other side. By the way, other people who arrived after us were stopped, so these canoes were actually being surveilled to catch people who were running away and to bring them back. We had time to cross over and we were already in Zaire and I don’t know if that’s where we heard a whistle or if it was coming from them…no, I heard the whistle before, and I saw the people coming down the hill. We arrived in Bukavu, and, I don’t know why, but I realized then why we were hearing whistles. I would hear the whistle and I would freeze. Even to this day, if I hear a whistle, I stop what I’m doing because I know that whistle means danger. So we went to Bukavu and André…in fact, we were very lucky because André had friends from Canada who, in 1972, wanted to go on a tour of Africa before returning to Canada. They were good friends of André’s and they had told him, “André, if you want, we can do the tour together, but we want you to put money aside, we won’t pay for everything, you have to put money aside.” So when we left…in fact, these friends, Albert and Paulette Lévesque, right before they left, they could see that it was the beginning of a period of instability. They dropped their world tour plan and decided to go straight back to Canada. But we were lucky that André had put money aside, otherwise we wouldn’t have had the money to do everything that we did.  So he had money and he was able to pass it on to someone who was to bring this money to us in Congo. I remember how anxious we were for having left all his money with that person. We were saying, “What if he doesn’t show up?” The guy had told him…so we crossed early in the morning and the guy had told him, “We’ll meet you at 4 o’clock, we’ll bring you the money at 4 o’clock.” From 3 o’clock on, we kept thinking: “What are we going to do if he doesn’t show up?” And then at 4 o’clock, the guy arrived, he gave André his money and that’s how we were able to…so we stayed for a very short time in Bukavu, we didn’t know many people. I was so…everything I told you about how we left…I had a small bag with some spare underwear, a toothbrush, and that’s all I had. I think André was carrying pretty much the same things, he didn’t even have a bag. We arrived in Bukavu, we felt safe, we said, “We’re going out to dance.” I went out dancing, and on the first day my bag got stolen with everything I had. So I was left with nothing and we didn’t stay long in Bukavu. He rented a car with other people, we drove through…we bypassed Rwanda…we drove through to Burundi. We felt all right in Burundi, because the people André was working for at Phillips were Belgians and one of his former bosses was in Bujumbura. So when we arrived in Bujumbura, we didn’t have to look for…finding homes or staying with families…we had maybe…in any case, we went right away to that Belgian man’s house and we lived there. We stayed there for 3-4 months; we lived very well and we were helping other refugees who were arriving and didn’t have a place to go. Us, we had food, we were doing very well. There were many refugees in Burundi, and for us life was easy there, during the whole time we stayed. Our goal was to go to Europe, to join Aimable in Germany or Émile in Belgium, and Assumpta was in Belgium too. In the meantime, I don’t remember how, Bello left Rwanda after us, he left in July after the fall of Kayibanda; he went to Congo to get Assumpta, and they left together, I don’t remember how, we didn’t hear from them. Anyway, I was with André, Bello was with Assumpta, and we thought, “We’ll see what happens, we will all meet at some point.” Many people helped us in Burundi and we were able to get our documents as refugees, our travel documents, we got travel documents and once we had them, we tried to…it was very complicated, but fortunately André was there, so we were able to obtain a visa to Germany. And from Germany…in fact, we wanted to go to France, because the white man who had accompanied us was from France, he was a very good friend of ours, and we thought that we could live in France, we spoke French—what were we going to do in Germany? We wanted to live in France. But France didn’t want to give us visas and Belgium didn’t either, so we went to Germany for a German visa and we got it. I don’t know how it happened then, but we left Burundi because André had put money aside and could buy plane tickets. We went to Congo, to Kinshasa…I think André had fallen in love with someone there, so he didn’t want to leave anymore, but I continued. I went to Germany. I remember, I arrived in Germany alone without speaking…it was the first time we took a plane and everything…but André joined me two weeks later. Our older brother was in Germany, at least, and Rosalie and the two girls were already there, they were already born. So we stayed in Germany, but we absolutely wanted to go to a place where people spoke French. We didn’t want to stay in Germany. While in Germany we got visas to France and we left. We went to Belgium to see how Émile was doing and then we went to France. After we arrived in France, we applied for refugee status there. But when you asked for refugee status, they took all your papers and they were the ones deciding when to call you. During that period of my life, ever since we spent time in Burundi, I realized that I couldn’t stay idle doing nothing. In Burundi I was telling André, “It’s good, we have a good life here, but I can’t live like this, I can’t continue living as though I’m on vacation. No, I completed my education as a nurse, I’m going to the hospital, I want to work. We can’t continue sitting around, drinking, going out, going to visit…that’s not a life.” So I was already fed up when I left Burundi, and now the same situation was happening again in France. Our papers were taken from us and we were told, “Yes, you’ve applied, but it will take time.” Fortunately, thanks to our friend Jean-Pierre, we went to Dijon, we lived with his parents. He got a car, he drove us around. We knew many French people who had gone to Rwanda to teach or work as doctors, so we went everywhere, we visited…it was good, but when you’ve done this for three-four months, you begin to think, “Damn! How are we going to live?” We depended on others, we didn’t have money. We were in touch with the people from Canada, André’s friends, who knew that we had fled, that we had gone to all these different places and that we were now in France. They told me, “Listen, you’ve done your nursing training and since you’ve studied with Canadian nurses we’ll see if we can push for you to immigrate here, because we need nurses.” And that’s how I…they had contacted Canadian nuns to ask for a job for me and they sent me a piece of paper saying that if I came to Canada, I was going to have a job. We had been in France for six months at that point. The Canadian embassy called me, they said, “Come to submit your application, you have a job in Canada.” André also tried, but he had studied sociology and he wasn’t as fortunate. So that’s how I was…I got my papers and my immigrant visa and I told France, “You can keep my documents, I don’t need them…” So I left and came to Canada in September, almost seven months later…it had been seven-eight months since I had left Rwanda. I came to Canada in September or October with an immigrant visa, except that the paper they had given me saying that I was going to get a job was a fake, it was just to make the process easier for me. So I got there, I had $100 in my pocket and I didn’t know anyone. André’s friends, who were in Rwanda before, had moved to Moncton. Fortunately, they had asked their family to pick me up at the airport. So I arrived and started my Canadian life in September 1973. I came to Canada with $100 in my pocket and I lived with Canadians, with some of our friends’ relatives. I don’t remember if they were medical students, they were never home, and when they spoke I didn’t understand a thing, I was constantly falling flat on my face…I thought, “I absolutely must find work.” I went to see the nuns who had given me the documents and they told me, “We can’t be hired because of the Ordre des infirmières—you have to go through the Ordre.” But it wasn’t an easy thing to do, you have to go there…they asked me to show all my diplomas and I hadn’t brought any documents with me… But I absolutely had to find work, so I said to the nuns, “But what am I going to do? I have to live, I need to work.” They said, “Well, we can attest that you’re indeed a nurse, and until your file is processed, you can work as a nursing assistant—in this way, you’ll get used to the work and everything.” I started working as a nursing assistant and right away I was…I started without much difficulty…I don’t think more than three weeks had passed before I started working. And since I knew I was going to be paid, I immediately rented an apartment. I was in a…it’s a kind of a residence, it still exists, the Maria Goretti Centre, on the corner of Côte-Sainte-Catherine and Decelles—I think its name has been changed now. I lived there. You could have a room there and if you wanted to have a phone in your room at the time I think it cost $90. So even with my salary I could live at the Maria Goretti Centre. I started working at the Sainte-Jeanne-d’Arc hospital, near Hôtel-Dieu. When I started, I was working from midnight to 8 in the morning, and then I was working from 8 am to 8 pm. At first, I was sleeping and eating very little because, on the one hand, I had no money in the beginning, but also I was so tired that all I wanted was to get to my bed. Working the night shift with my colleagues was not…we didn’t have much interaction with people, and with the clients, I didn’t understand at all what they were asking me. I was looking at what the others were doing and I was imitating them because I was bad and incompetent at this job, but there weren’t many techniques to learn at night, so it was okay. Ever since I studied nursing, all I was interested in, the only thing that interested me was psychiatry. Psychiatry was what fascinated me a little bit during the three years of studies. But in Rwanda at the time, there wasn’t even a psychiatric hospital, what we were learning was very theoretical, so I didn’t even have…but I found it fascinating to work with the raving mad…and in Rwanda the crazy people that we could see were all raving mad and they were walking out in the street, they were all naked with their hair on one side…but that’s what I was interested in. And that interest persisted. When I came to Canada, I said to myself, “Why not work at a psychiatric hospital?” So while I was waiting for the equivalency of my diplomas to be recognized as a nurse, I worked there. Yes, those who didn’t know anything about Black people or Africa would ask me, “Is it in South America?” I wasn’t talking to them about Rwanda, I spoke about Africa—they didn’t know about it. I met Haitians, but I hadn’t read much about Haiti either…it’s Africans…between the Whites who didn’t know about Africa, the Blacks who didn’t know about Africa… I was living…in fact, I had no life, no friends, I worked, I put money aside, I read—I love to read—and all I was thinking was, “In six months or when I have time off for vacation, I’m going to Belgium or Germany to see my family”—that’s all I was interested in. Making friends with the Canadians wasn’t possible: we didn’t understand each other, they found me silly, maybe, and I found them impossible to understand. When I arrived at the Maria Goretti Centre…it was a centre for women, but I was working at night, I only went there to sleep, I didn’t even know where I could have breakfast. Finally, someone told that I had to go through the pharmacy next door, there was a cafeteria at the far end of the pharmacy, and that’s where…so, I would go there for a meal and then I would go to bed, then I would wake up in the evening, the cafeteria was closed, by the time I got ready, I had to go back to work. The first three months were…eventually, I met a woman who was working there, her name was Diane, a Quebecker who worked at the Sainte-Justine Hospital right next door. She had spent some time in Africa, in Gabon, she had just come back from Africa, so here was, finally, someone who knew about Africa. We talked a lot, we became friends. She asked me where I worked, she gave me tips on how to…: “If you want to do that, you can check for job postings, you can ask for an evening shift, the work is harder during the day, but you can have an evening position.” She was the one who…she was a very good friend. And I told her, “I’ve always wanted to work in psychiatry.” She said, “There is a big psychiatric hospital in Montreal’s East End, you can apply there, they’re always looking for nurses.” I applied. Back then, it was called Saint-Jean-de-Dieu, and now it’s Louis-Hyppolyte-Lafontaine. So, I applied…she taught me how to take the bus and all that, and then I applied and I was hired. And she said, “My parents work near there, they have a house nearby and if you want, you can rent a room at my parents’ house.” So I started working…I left downtown and I was in the East End, I worked at the hospital and I lived with this Quebec family and I integrated very quickly, both professionally and socially.   I was with that family, they were like my family. Their house was at the lower banks of the St. Lawrence River. During the holidays we went down to the river…they really adopted me. They adopted me, but nevertheless, I thought the relationship was a bit cold. At least they had daughters who were my age and it was okay. I was living with a Quebec family, I was learning, I had a strong Quebec accent—I became more Quebecker than the Quebeckers. Once I had settled, I had my job, I had my small room and in the meantime I got a boyfriend who came to join me in Canada. The French man who had saved us had become my boyfriend, he joined me in Canada. And that’s it. It was, however, a difficult time in the sense that…I was free, I had everything I wanted, but at the same time I could sense my mother’s eyes on me, watching me, my older brothers watching me too: having a boyfriend—this was in 1974—and deciding to live with him without being married…I wasn’t comfortable with that, so I was living…I think I had internalized deeply our culture through my education and I didn’t want to hurt my mother. I thought, “My God, I’m living with a guy.” We weren’t married, but it was nice to have someone I knew and who knew Rwanda. It helped me get through those first years and my work and everything. But I said to him, “Jean-Pierre, we can’t live together without being married, it’s impossible.” Since he had lived in Rwanda, he knew that. We had to do gusaba, we had to. I said, “No, we have to do that, my mother lives in Rwanda.” So he arranged everything, he had friends, one of whom was still in Rwanda and he asked him to buy a cow, to do gusaba and all that. Things were getting in order, I thought. We had decided to get married in May, end of May, a civil marriage in Canada and then a religious marriage in France with his parents and my relatives who would come from Germany and Belgium. They did the engagement ceremony in Rwanda, they did the gusaba ceremony in Rwanda, and then in May, I think two weeks before we were to marry…I always had a gut feeling…I felt unhappy. I thought, “Am I making a mistake?” He asked me, “But why do you think that?” “I’m getting married to please people, to please my mother who’s not here, my brothers who are not here, but I don’t feel that I really love you and that I want to live with you. We would be unhappy living together.” He dreamed of having a farm, raising chickens and I’m a city girl—don’t talk to me about chickens, I can’t even touch a chicken! But he was amazing. He’s still a great friend, to this day, he’s our best friend, we stay with him when we go to Canada. He told me, “If you don’t want to get married, don’t. You shouldn’t feel obliged to get married.” And so even though we had invited people—we didn’t know many people in Canada, there were maybe twenty people who were coming to our wedding—we canceled. We had sent invitations to France too and we wrote them a letter, saying: “We are not getting married anymore, but we still love each other. We’ll be coming to France for the holidays. All is well,” signed… When they received that, it was the biggest shock of my brothers’ lives. But what I mean to say is that you’re doing things in life…in Rwanda…I want to get married…at the same time, there’s a problem…you’re going out, you’re meeting people, you’re thinking, “What am I doing?” That’s what Canada has taught me, one of the things it has taught me: to confront, to come to terms with, to discuss, to feel the freedom and at the same time to learn to use it properly. Learning how to use it was, I think, my education, it’s how I was raised. Even if I didn’t have much freedom in Rwanda, once I had it in Canada, I could make choices and I felt very comfortable. So, in the example of the marriage canceled a few days before it happened, I was able to ask myself, “Wait, is this really what I want? Even if they get angry, even if my mother is unhappy because she has a cow and I’m not married, that’s all right.” And, you see, after that I went back to France. My dream was to work, to work more hours, to have money, to pay for my trips, to go see my family during…that was it. After that my boyfriend went back to France, I started looking for, seeking out Rwandans—but where were the Rwandans? There were only a few of them at the time, but I met them, the three-four Rwandans who were there, I met them, and I felt so free. I was living a good life. I bought a car. One of my cousins was in California, and I’ve always dreamed of travelling, so I said to him, “Arthur, I want to come visit you in California,” and I went to California. We went to San Francisco. The good life… And every year I went on holiday in Europe to see my sister, my friends, my brothers, my nieces that I love so much. To me it was clear: I was in Canada, I chose to stay there, I was a refugee, but all I wanted was to live in Africa. So I thought, “I’m in Canada now,”—at that time you had to spend five years in Canada to get citizenship—“after five years I know I can’t go back to Rwanda, it’s out of the question, so after five years, I’ll have my papers and being a nurse…” That’s what saved me…even though I don’t like the nursing profession, it’s a good occupation for international work. So I said to myself that I would look for nursing positions. In any case, working as a nurse doesn’t necessarily mean working at the hospital, it could also mean work in education, and that’s what interested me. So I thought, “When my four years here are up…,” just thinking that “next year I’m going to be Canadian”…I started at the same time to look for jobs with international NGOs, like those I had known in Rwanda, NGOs, volunteers and all that, and I was thinking to myself, “I won’t go back to Rwanda, but I will be somewhere else and I will be Canadian.” So to me it was very clear. It was all good: in four years, I was going to be a Canadian citizen, I’d be happy with the advantages that gives me, but I was going to live in Africa. I love travelling, I love discovering new countries, I thought to myself that I would discover African countries—I didn’t know any, except Burundi and Congo. So I was living my life of a 25-year-old young woman who was going out, having fun, and at the same time I was making sure my affairs were in order. And that’s how when I got my citizenship—it was in May—the same month or the month after I left for Guinea Bissau. I had contacted CECI, SUCO, the francophone organizations in Montreal, then I became a Canadian citizen, and then a month later I had my ticket to Guinea Bissau. I didn’t know it was a Portuguese territory and we had to have at least a notion of Portuguese—I did all that and I left for Guinea Bissau. I was with a large team of Quebeckers and that’s when I met Pierre. Pierre had arrived in Guinea Bissau six months earlier to work as a doctor. He had gone there in December and I arrived in June. I was the only nurse and there were two doctors who had to go to the hospitals outside of…and Pierre’s hospital opened first; the other doctor was a woman and her hospital took a long time to open. When I arrived, I was in Bissau for a little bit and then when Pierre’s hospital was ready, we were already part of the same group of friends, and when his hospital opened, I went to work with Pierre. We haven’t separated since then, it was 1978. And before that—I won’t tell you all my love stories—but before leaving, I was going out with a Rwandan man and he left me. I loved him passionately, but I knew very well that I could never live with a guy like that. He’s a man you love because there is something about him, but you feel that it’s very—it’s short-lived. At the same time, I felt trapped. I was thinking, “No, that’s not normal, I’m going to leave him.” He was very intense, and I didn’t feel good, and he wasn’t being very clear either. Anyway, all this to say that when I met Pierre, he was the opposite of that guy: a calm person who lives in the moment, who…and you know what—it was the first time I found myself in a canoe again. There was a canoe there and Pierre taught me how to go into the canoe. We would go to the local bar, we would be in the little neighbourhood bar, buying beers for the locals, learning more about them—and about life. At the same time, we were working hard. I lived in Guinea Bissau for two years, I was working and at the same time I found an extraordinary guy who taught me…I had a car, but I had never learned how to ride a bike, and since we didn’t have a lot of money, we bought a bike, he taught me how to ride it. I too bought a bike so we could go out, go to the countryside, do more community work, teach people about basic health, you know, just the basics. Another hospital opened and we started working there too. Then Pierre bought a motorcycle, he taught me how to ride a motorcycle, and then I bought a motorcycle, we went on many rides together and just wandered around…Those were two beautiful years. Two beautiful years when I was happy to be in Africa again, to see a different country than Rwanda. I was happy. I just wanted to live in Africa, I knew that living in Rwanda was impossible, etc. After that, we left Guinea Bissau, we decided to get married, we had our children, we lived in Canada for four years after Guinea Bissau. We went back, we got married in Canada, we lived there and I was working, but I had a choice: to work or…I didn’t really work as a nurse anymore, I worked more as a…how do you call them?...professional…I don’t know what the right word is…community worker…I was working at a centre for battered women. I worked in the community sector for a long time. And since I had children, I didn’t want to work full-time either. And so we lived there. On our return [from Guinea Bissau], I had a husband and I also had my husband’s family who are lovely, who welcomed me with open arms. At the same time, when…in fact, we could have maybe continued living in Guinea Bissau, but my brother Émile, who in the meanwhile had returned to Rwanda, decided to leave again because in 1979 the situation had become unbearable. And he took Mom with him too, because he thought that if we left her behind, that would kill her. So Mom also went to Germany, then to Canada, then she went back to Germany. She wanted to wait for me to come back from Guinea Bissau and to go live with her in Canada. She wanted to live with me more than with my brother Émile. So when I learned that my mother had left Rwanda, I said to Pierre, “We’ll finish our two years here, we won’t extend our stay and we’ll leave.” We went to Germany, took Mom with us from there and I came back to Canada with my husband, with my mother, and with my happy in-laws. Life was very…those were good times. I was with my mom who was watching the world around her, learning how to live in another country and with Pierre’s family who had strong bonds between them. We went to their house every Sunday, we always had meals together. Mom lived not far from us, close to me, so I was spending a lot of time with her. She was also helping me with the kids. It was a joyful life. But we kept saying that we were itching to leave again. We lived in Canada for four years and in the meantime Aimable came to Quebec and Bello, Assumpta, Émile had also arrived previously, so my extended family was there too. Four years later, we went to Ivory Coast. So, Guinea Bissau from 1978 to 1980, then 1980 to 1984 in Montreal, and then we decided to go work in Ivory Coast. We had two children, we decided to leave and barely—in 1984, in June—and then my mother died in September 1984. She was ill, she started to get sick just before we left. I said to Pierre, “This is very important.” We went to see many doctors and when we left Montreal she was in the hospital, she was hospitalized and we were waiting to hear the diagnosis. I told Pierre, “I can’t leave.” Pierre said, “But if we don’t leave, she would think that we’re hiding something from her, it’ll be okay.” So we left for three months, four months. After that she got worse and then she died.Yes, they did. It’s an autoimmune disease, very rare, they say there are only a few cases—it’s called cryoglobulin, it attacks the red blood cells. But we couldn’t have known…apparently, there were eight cases in the world. So, that’s it. I started my life in Ivory Coast, I was an orphan, but at the same time I had my own family. And I knew exactly what I wanted: I wanted to create links with Africa. I thought to myself, “Well, if we know how to do”…we knew what to do in Ivory Coast, based on our experience in Guinea Bissau, we wanted to work with the Ivorians so they could do the work on their own, without us. These were very nice years, four years in Ivory Coast—I was there for four years. In 1988 we came back to Canada. At that time, I decided to do my master’s degree in community health and Pierre worked hard as a doctor and as a consultant and he continued to travel often to Haiti. And, you know, we lived like people with more opportunities. For example, when Pierre went to work in Haiti for three months, I could leave for the holidays with the three boys and go live with him. I have always wanted to get to know more countries, more people. When I came back in 1988, I always kept in touch with Africa, for me that was essential. And at that time we created an organization called Solidarité femmes africaines, because I’ve always wanted to…I think that I wanted to cut ties with Rwanda, I knew we wouldn’t be going back there. But at the same time, I always wanted to work with Africans. Working with Rwandans to improve our living conditions here—fine[1]. But I didn’t want to collaborate with Rwandans, because they are Rwandans, because we still have this division between Hutus and Tutsis, even if we don’t say it out loud. Even if you don’t think that way, others will think that you do, and it’ll affect everything you do. So I said, “Rwanda is too small. Let’s consider Africa.” There is so much need on the part of immigrants and refugees. During my master’s degree in community health I worked for many organizations, for NGOs, where I was doing projects with refugees. I worked on the Milieu Project during which we studied a group of immigrants who lived in the northeast part of the city, in really incredible conditions, and we wanted to see how we could make life easier for them and have health services brought closer to them. So I’ve always worked with refugees, immigrants. That’s what I’m interested in. I thought that they were among the most vulnerable people in society and that I could do something for them. So I did that while working on my master’s, and I continued to work with immigrants, to give information sessions to newcomers. It was nice doing the…we wrote grant applications for HIV prevention projects in the African community using forum theater. We started that, and I was the coordinator for the project. I did things that I liked doing. And what I really liked was to be with immigrant women because I think we create a lot of…we say society is racist, society is this and that, but people judge us by our actions. Some people are racist—you are a Black person, some don’t see anything wrong, but there are others who would say, “The Africans, they do this, they do that.” Sometimes, however, people do things because they don’t know, because they have never…like this woman…one organization approached us saying, “You have to tell them how to clean the floors.” In Africa, in Haiti, you clean the floors with big swoops, you rub, and that’s the way you know how to clean. But when you have hardwood floors and you pour water on them, it trickles down to the neighbours’. But you have to take the time, there must be people who know how to work with immigrants and refugees, who know these small issues and who can explain so there are less misunderstandings and therefore fewer conflicts. You are afraid of misunderstandings, you have the impression that…you know, an African could be at the bank or he could be serving someone…he’ll place his paper over there and that’s how it’s done here, and if you don’t tell him: “Here in Quebec, in the West, things are done this way”…in this way people will do things the way they should be done. When you come from a country where nobody lines up for anything and where you have to rush to get on the bus, people would say, “The Africans think they are…these Black people…” Blacks will be blamed, whereas it’s one individual who is reproducing what was done before. For us, in any case, in our organization, it was important to say, “There have to be people—Africans, immigrants—there must be people who are familiar with these problems, who can talk to people and introduce them to these new ways of life so that there are fewer conflicts.” Otherwise, problems start from little things, from something small that enflames everything and conflicts begin. So if we can prevent misunderstandings…I work with immigrants, I’ve worked with survivors too, but mostly with immigrants and refugees, and even when I had…sometimes I would think, “Well, in this circle of friends…,” but sometimes I…when I left this work environment, it was because I wanted to work with young people. My children were at an age when we risked living parallel lives: they have their lives, I have an African life, I am a Canadian mother, but I need to know what’s going on, I need to know about children and youth issues, I wanted to know more about drugs, because I thought that there were a lot of drugs in our community….as a Rwandan and African woman. I decided to start working in…there was a new project—I love starting projects and I don’t like to remain for long with the same project—and it was a project that we were just beginning. We wanted to reach out to young people who lived on the street, who had problems with heroin use. We wanted to see how we can help them get access…the other programs offered were for adults, and they were working well, while there were cases of young people…when you are addicted to heroin, there are very few spots…you had to call at 1 pm on a Monday to reserve a spot, but for that you have to know that it is a Monday, you have to know that it’s 1 o’clock, so you have to have the, at the time, 25 cents… So they realized that youth didn’t have access to those services and they decided to open a program for people on the street and I was its first coordinator. I got implicated by curiosity, to get to know the problems that young people were facing and possibly others too who didn’t have access to these programs. I remember during the interview they told me, “But you don’t have any experience working with drug addiction.” “No, I don’t have any experience with drugs, but drugs are…I don’t have experience with drugs, I haven’t worked with youth before, but I have experience working with people more generally, I have experience working with battered women, I have experience working with refugees, immigrants. And I…people who take drugs…and I can build on with my experience working with vulnerable people by taking courses on drug addiction, on what needs to be administered, on heroin, methadone, cocaine, and everything that goes along with it, I can learn that easily. But establishing rapport with the most vulnerable people, that experience I have—is that what you want? I have that.” And that’s how I got the job. And so, until I decided to come to Rwanda, I worked with young people and drug addiction, and I still work with immigrants through our pan-African project.And she was a strong woman, principled too, who taught me many things because, as you know, in the Rwandan tradition, being the youngest in the family—and since my grandfather had died in the 1940s—my father sent me to live with Grandma. She used to call me her little husband!You know how we say that in our culture. She influenced me a lot. She was the one that transmitted to me all the knowledge, all I needed to know about my family because I didn’t have the chance to meet my grandfather, it was she who talked to me about him. And my grandmother’s strength, it—I especially appreciated it in the difficult years 1959–1960, yes, because I remember, for example, that when they were burning the houses, when they were destroying our households, everyone was fleeing to Ngoma, in the parish there, but grandmother, she sat in front of her pen and she was saying: “Ndashaka kureba umwana w\\'imbwa uza kuntwikira inzu kandi arinjye wamubyaje.”In French it means: “I’d like to see the little rascal who dares set my house on fire while it was me who delivered him at birth.” And she stayed there. And the people who were attacking the houses, when they saw her, they didn’t dare come near her house. But they were cowards and took advantage of the darkness of the night to burn her house, while she was inside. Fortunately, she had foreseen this and she had gone elsewhere, to sleep in someone else\\'s house that night. I have great memories, great memories of my family… I don’t know if I want to talk about my brothers and sisters just yet…During the genocide. All of them, because in the family, of course, it is the eldest in the family who bears the burden because he’s the one who should lead the troops, so to speak. My father—he grew up with the missionaries, because he worked for them and he had this goal—he wanted at least one of the brothers to be a clergy—a religious sister and a priest. We had a brother who was clergy, we had a——in Kansi. And then, when we, the young seminarians, arrived in Bujumbura, our former rector, Father Joseph Nyirumugabo, had already arrived there before us. As soon as he reached Bujumbura, he made sure that all those who came from the Petit Séminaire in Rwanda could find a place in the Kanyosha Petit Séminaire in Bujumbura. I got a place in the school without a problem, but Vincent wasn’t so lucky. What happened eventually was that in July, after Habyarimana’s coup d\\'état, and since Vincent was not doing anything in Bujumbura and his classmates were going back to school, he decided to return to Rwanda, unfortunately, and that’s what happened. My big sister, the only daughter in the family, Godelieve, her story is extremely sad, because she married a Congolese, a Zairian at the time, who was working in a biochemistry lab at Lubumbashi University, and so she moved to Lubumbashi. She lived there with her husband, she had two children, and since there were a lot of—she spent a long time there without paying a visit to the family. In 1996—no, 1986–87, I think—she asked her husband\\'s permission to travel to our family house so that our relatives could meet her children, and the husband gave her permission. She came with the two children, her son and daughter Eric and Catherine, and she was pregnant too. On her way there, she passed through Bujumbura and I accompanied her to the border because I couldn’t cross the border. She then continued on her way. A year later I went to work in southern Africa, in Swaziland. So, while she was home, she had—she found a job with a Canadian NGO and she talked to her husband about it, and her husband said, “Listen, given the economic situation in Zaire, the chaos that reigns here, it might be better that you stay working there, if you are earning better money than here, you can help us too.” She had her baby, Rodrigue, there; the two older ones, Eric and Catherine, started primary and then secondary school. The genocide caught up with them there and that’s what’s striking: Godelieve was killed, the two children, Eric and Catherine, were also killed in the secondary schools where they were, in their boarding school, and, imagine, the one who survived the genocide is precisely the child she was carrying when she came to vising home. That boy, whose name is Rodrigue, is now a student at the Butare University. He’s a good boy, but he doesn’t know his father, and his father doesn’t know him either.I don’t even know, I don’t know. I had the opportunity to meet some people from Congo when I was working in Switzerland, near Geneva, I met some people from Congo and I asked them—because some of them were from Lubumbashi—to tell him what was left of his family, that he [Rodrigue] existed. I didn’t hear back from these people, but he managed to trace some of his paternal relatives on Facebook. Basically that\\'s what I can say about my immediate family. Unfortunately, of all the adults, I’m the only survivor and I had the chance to bring here those who were also alive, that is, Jean-Blanchard, Blandine and Raïssa [or Larissa? – translator’s note].At the Petit Séminaire it wasn’t—it wasn’t really—especially in Kansi, these were, I would say, the best moments of my youth, particularly because of the teachers we had. I had the good fortune to know people who were, I would say, exceptional, like Bishop Alexis Kagame, he was the director of our Petit Séminaire, and Father Boniface Musoni, Father Joseph Niyomugabo who later served as Rector. At the Petit Séminaire in Kansi, it was complete harmony, complete harmony. But, I think something was brewing because of certain individuals. But it wasn’t out in the open, it wasn’t out in the open until 1994. During the first grades of the seminary, in Save, yes, there were vestiges there of the 1960s, mostly conveyed by—you know the Diocese of Butare included part of Gitarama, a large part of Gikongoro, if not all of Gikongoro, and Butare.But those who were in fifth grade Latin also protected the kids who came from the same parish as us. But we were realizing more and more, especially in the years between 1970 and 1972, that this protection was happening along other lines, you see, and the other children who were in fifth grade were questioned if they knew of any Tutsi children who would also be coming to the school. And, we believed it was our duty to protect them. Because the hazing, it had taken a rather ethnic turn—Yes, yes, we protected them. We would ask the kids who came from other parishes to tell us: are there Tutsi kids in seventh grade who are likely to come to sixth grade Latin?He really was a philosopher. The others I know—I remember Deo Byanafashe, the Nkusis, and so on. They were people who—no, I never saw—whether they were Hutu or Tutsi—I never saw any such tendencies.The Butare team was called Dynamo and I was the captain at the time, so he knew me. When this commando arrived, they—they went into the schools, it was around 2 o’clock, and strangely, we noticed that the teachers weren’t there, while the school had to start, the class had to start. They were already gone. And then we saw two or three vans filled with students carrying knives, machetes and so on. And then they went into the classrooms and said that all the Tutsis had to go out. The other students, my classmates said, “No, don’t go out.” The Hutus told us not to go out. We remained seated and I—my bench was at the back and then this Jean, came up to me with a knife and put it on my throat and said, “You too, Richard, you can’t—can you pretend you\\'re not a Tutsi? Stand up.” I got up, but another student was telling me, “Sit down.” But listen, the first guy had a knife. So I went out and the whole class was out as well.Then the leader of the commandos, the commando of [inaudible] said, “Well, then, everyone should clear out!” And we all laughed. [laughs]But a few months later, we learned that a certain Célestin of Kiruhura Parish, Ntahobatuye, had been summoned by Bishop Gahamanyi to make lists of students on the basis of their ethnicity. They sent flyers to the schools—or to the parishes, rather—and it was only the Hutus who were called back to school. We were left on the hills and that\\'s when we decided to leave.This wasn’t the first nor the biggest blunder that he’s done, especially… Anyway, it’s a shame, but it is what it is. The truth must be told.Had I been in his place, what would I have done?Because when he was young, he was brave. One would think that as a priest, he would have been even more courageous. He would have protected his flock rather than shoot at them. I think he’s in prison now.There were ups and downs, depending on the mood of the moment and depending on the events, but we noticed that every time there was a crisis of some kind, it wasn’t easy. It wasn’t easy because, for example, if there was a crisis in Burundi it affected us on the hills as well. The tensions on the hills between people, in fact, weren’t that obvious. But the incendiary speeches of President Kayibanda, for example, were very well received by the Hutu population of the hills, the vast majority of them, not everyone but the vast majority, liked what they were hearing. So there were moments of tension from 1959 to 1961, and in ‘63, ‘64, right?Even if it is only thirty kilometers from us, there were no killings—the people from, say, Bufundu were fleeing to Butare and to our hills—there were no physical killings, but there was tension, the tension was palpable. I don’t know—I don’t know anyone who was killed on our hills and the surrounding hills of Butare in general, but there was tension. It wasn’t at all—we weren’t at all at ease during certain times of the year when things happened, like the inyenzi’s arrival in the Nshili, or something like that. And if there was a social or an economic crisis and if President Kayibanda said something on the radio—that was enough for people to start sharpening their machetes. But in general, well, it wasn’t so bad, the relations between the villagers, the people living on the hills weren’t so bad.No, I mean in Burundi, I had just finished high school.Yes, but for some time—so right after 1960–62, I have to say that during the rebuilding of our house, I lived in Matyazo, and I got to know some very interesting people like the beautiful family Mugesera—So I know this family very well.And more than that, at the Petit Séminaire, I must say that in my class, there were some people who were very well-known, in one way or another: Father Furaha Justin was in my class, Hormisdas Nsengimana, Martin Kabarira, Father Pierre Ngoga who, by the way, worked with my father—I only risked going back at the end of high school, because I wanted to ask my parents for a kind of—let\\'s say—how can I say this?—guidance. Tell them that I couldn’t be a priest, for very personal reasons, but also tell them what I had decided to study at the university. I went back clandestinely. There were some crossing points where you didn’t have to go through customs—I think he lived in Nyaruteja. So I reached home the next day. And I had planned to stay there for the summer holidays because the university classes started in September. But an old friend, a former classmate from Save, who worked at the Commune, came to warn me that the security agents were after me.They were all killed. Yes, a few of the women who were married to Hutus may be still alive, but the rest, everyone else, all the Tutsis and their families, were killed.Because I wanted to give tools to my fellow Rwandans—so they could consider other ways of resolving their conflicts. And of course, I roamed around the land, with my family, because I thought—okay, I went to the hill, on the hill, and the area has become a jungle, even the trails have disappeared, things that I don’t even know what they are, are sprouting, new kinds of wild plants that I don’t recognize. And so I went there, I was made to believe that my whole family had—that even my father and my mother, were buried in Magonde with the victims from Sovu, from Nyanza—Yes, in a mass grave. I went to pay my respects, and I was urging friends in Montreal who had some influence, perhaps, to ask the Rwandan authorities to give decent tombstones to those people. Apparently, there are between 3,000 and 4,000 bodies in this mass grave. And then Jean-Blanchard came, I spoke to him and it was him who told me that the bodies of my parents were not in that grave, after all, and that they had been burned alive in the house. So, I only learned this last year.The others, my sister and Canisius, were killed in the Butare hospital, I think? [looks at Jean-Blanchard] So, my sister Godelieve and Canisius. Their dad [Vincent, R.B.’s brother – translator’s note] was killed when he went to—he was deputy director of SOS Children\\'s Villages in Kacyiru, which was from—with the Belgian Red Cross. It’s a terrible story because, in fact, he had resisted physically, and later he had managed—he was blackmailed, that if he didn’t cooperate, they were going to kill him [he points at Jean-Blanchard], he was a baby, well, he was still very young. Vincent had to abide.It’s… It’s hard to describe, it’s actually impossible to describe. In fact, you find yourself in a situation where you would like to know how it happened and then you put yourself in their place and you don’t want to know, because that is a detail that my father and my mother… And what about the others? Is it, one wonders, is it worth it knowing the details? But I think it’s worth it, you have to go through that. If you know the details—the real ones, anyway—at least that prevents us from speculating.Yes. And I don’t think I\\'m the only one in this situation. The fear of knowing or of wanting to know the truth, and also the need to know this truth.Those who are there are not the killers, but their relatives. But my first contact with them made me understand, in fact, the depth of the distress that they have also experienced. I went to see a cousin of mine who was, I think, the area manager. And these people saw me at her house because they were there too—it was the day of the first communion of my cousin’s children. And then when I left, they followed me. [a long silence] So the distance between our house and Butare is only five kilometers and I walked from Butare to our house on the hill, and back again. And they followed me, but without saying a word. The only person I talked to was an old man named Joseph Gatabazi, and when I spoke to him he said, “Richard, we ate the beast with seven—with eight teats…” I didn’t understand what he meant: “We ate the beast with eight teats”—“igikoko cy\\'amabere umunani.” It was his way of telling me that they had eaten the inedible, meaning their dog.And, indeed, they told me that “Yes, there is—yes, he’s gone—I think he’s dead,” things like that. But those who had stayed there were… Listen, they probably were interested observers, but most of them probably didn’t kill anyone.No. I feel a sense of belonging because I’m Rwandan. My hill, I know my hill as I know myself, it’s like my own body, but when I went back nothing is left there for me! But even if you blindfolded me and told me we’re at such and such a place on the hill of [inaudible: Rugimbi?], I can lead you to my house. I can tell you when we have come close to a rock and what can be seen on it, and that this or that is to my left—I can tell you all this with my eyes closed, I’ve played on this hill since I was three years old.Right? His big sister was killed, his mother was killed, his big brother was killed, and someone would come and tell me that Rodrigue is not a survivor because he is not Rwandan? That he’s not Tutsi, that he’s not even Hutu—it’s completely absurd. Second, I think that people sometimes suffer from—quite often, in fact—certain egocentrism that tends to exclude, to put other people outside the definition of survivors. And we define who is a survivor according to our own egocentrism. That’s not normal, it’s even “insane,” as they say in English. It’s unhealthy, it’s unhealthy and it’s surprising that someone whose whole family is alive, intact, and despite all the trauma that they’ve been through, the father, the mother, the seven brothers, the three sisters, everyone is still there and this person thinks he has the right to judge others whether they are not survivors because it didn’t happen while they were in Rwanda. I’m the only one remaining of the adults in my family, so some people are questioning whether I am a survivor. Listen, that’s completely crazy, these people must have some kind of problem [makes a sign with his hand], it’s crazy to try to exclude me or give me points that do or don’t qualify me as a survivor.I can perhaps understand the narcissistic propensity that pushes people towards egocentrism and makes them define who is a survivor according to their own understanding, limiting the definition to what suits them, but excluding others. And how we can measure the suffering of those who are then positioned outside of these limits of the definition of a survivor—it’s completely dishonest, it’s even—no, frankly, I…It’s very difficult because, you know, the problem—an identity problem is very difficult to delineate. And I can’t say either that complete harmony reigns between the different groups, the different identities that we have, Hutus and Tutsis, etc. It’s not 100 percent harmony either. And in each identity group there are subgroups that are also created, unfortunately, according to completely new parameters. In fact, there are no ethnic groups in Rwanda, there are only Rwandans. Well, the relations between—within the community are friendly, the interpersonal relations, but when we refer to Hutus, Tutsis, it depends on who you are talking about. Some people are known to be very open to friendly relationships with everyone. And these people are not necessarily welcome in some communities, Hutus for example. Well, what can you do? We’re talking about reconciliation efforts, for example in Rwanda, we’re talking about efforts to bring together Hutus and Tutsis in the diaspora—there are some Hutus who don’t want that, right? There are probably also Tutsis who don’t want that. But the vast majority—well, I think it’s a question of education, but also of personal willingness to open up to the other. I know, personally, that there is a lot of ignorance on both sides, which produces—people give, so to speak—put labels on others that they don’t even know.And when we meet a person for the first time, our first reaction is one of astonishment: “My God!” We begin to discover the human face of the other, the unknown other. So what we’re lacking is, I would say, chances to meet, on neutral ground, where everyone can express this desire to want to connect with others. This is what we’re missing and if such opportunities exist—and they do, for example, the people who go to church to pray, they sing together and pray to the good Lord, but what happens after the Mass? They go back to who they were before. What good is it if we only pretend that prayer can help us to be more mature and wiser?Exactly. You see, it’s odd, no, I’m not going to waste my time praying in these circumstances because it’s completely—it’s hogwash.No, it—I think that I learned, rather, to understand humanity better. Why? Because human beings make choices; and sometimes they choose destruction, right? And, I am not a person to—why wouldn’t I make completely aberrant choices, right? So I always lend credibility to human beings. Except that there are individuals who don’t want to take responsibility precisely as human beings. When I hear someone say on the radio or on television, “I did this because the devil tempted me.” That’s—I think that we must give credit to human beings all the while knowing that they are capable of anything, the best and the worst. As I was saying, I spoke of Thaddeus, I saw him at his most positive moments, and I also know him at his worst moments. But in all situations he was the same person. So, I always trust humans, knowing that you have to be careful too.Whether you\\'re in Canada or in Rwanda, and when you\\'re a genocide survivor, there’s not a single free moment when the thought of the genocide does not gnaw at you, day after day, at any time, wherever you are. There hasn’t been a single day, it\\'s impossible—since ‘94, there hasn’t been a single day that we haven’t thought about the genocide. Impossible, impossible! Yes, well, listen, the ideal for me would be to grow old on the green hills of my dear country—that’s the ideal, yes. But one question persists: How can we be sure that there won’t be other genocides? [smiling] The reasons that caused the genocide are still there.The first question you are asking—How do people come to commit unspeakable acts? Essentially, this is a question about good and evil. How can one choose evil, the absolute evil? In fact… [long silence] When genocide perpetrators are questioned—I’ve never heard a single one of them, not a single one say that he’s committed the genocidal act with joy—they always look for nonexistent pretexts. In fact, these are also strategies of surviving the evil that they’ve committed. But in the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment, you have to equip yourself with tools that will allow you to carry out that action. One of the most common such tools is to justify precisely the unspeakable, it’s the demonization, the dehumanization of the victim. The very name by which the victims are called—inzoka, snake, cockroach, vermin, rat—sanctions an act believed to be legitimate or acceptable or justifiable because one wants to eradicate something considered dirty, bad, dangerous or not acceptable. So if one thinks they’re killing a snake, if one thinks they’re killing a rat, a cockroach, one thinks that what they’re doing is cleaning. That\\'s why it’s called “work,” gukora, right? Gukora is a noble act, work that ennobles the individual; gukora, an acceptable act. It’s when the heat of the moment passes that one begins to ask the real questions and one looks for strategies of survival after what has been done. So how can someone like that survive and find their humanity? They must first accept, define, name their true actions with real terms. They are—they’ve committed the irreparable. In fact, when we talk about reconciliation, in general, it’s—the person, the individual should first come to reconciliation with himself, because before committing this act, one was a human being. During the act, when one commits the unspeakable, one is no longer a human being. How to return to this humanity? It’s not me who’ll give it back to him, it’s up to him to come to terms with—to reconcile the beast that he became and the human that he was before. It’s a personal effort. And after, one can say, “What I did is unimaginable, do I feel remorse? Do I want to repent? Am I ready to ask for forgiveness? And how can I make the victim understand? If what I say is truly authentic, how can the victim understand that my actions are sincere?” There are very few people, among the killers, who accept to take that step. Whereas the second question, I think it’s more related to—To the victims! And here too, it is necessary that the victims reconcile first with their own selves, because they have been dehumanized, and so it is up to them to find again their humanity with the help of the existing services that can support them. Here, I think, the authorities, the government, or the authorities more broadly, can play an important role using the existing resources, but also the existing specialized services to which, unfortunately, not everyone has access. You mentioned PTSD. The last time we spoke, you told us that 72 percent of Rwandans—It’s not possible. One can’t deny it. Can’t deny it. [silence] Because, you see… [sigh] And this also perhaps goes back to the previous question you asked about who is considered a survivor. We have children, these children will have children—can we say that those children are survivors? Absolutely. That\\'s precisely the message that should be sent to people who label others, isn’t it? Because if my son asks me, “How come I don’t have aunts, uncles, grandparents?”—what explanation do you want me to give to a child who was born in Canada? And what will be his explanation to his own children? I think we should be honest with ourselves and think beyond our own little ego and say, “Yes, it concerns us all.” There is not one who is more concerned than others—everyone is.It has changed in the fact that… I remain a believer with all the conviction in my faith that I have always had. I am still a believer. What has changed is my attitude towards the intermediaries between me and God, that\\'s all. And I’m including everyone in this. I think I follow the precepts of what I’ve learned in my Catholic religion, but I’m also thinking: all the intermediaries between me and God, starting with the priest of the parish all the way up to the pope—I now choose my people. Just because you’re wearing a cassock doesn’t give you the authority to teach me how to live my faith. The best prayer for me—for anyone—are one’s actions, not memorizing the Bible or the— [inaudible] For me, it’s not that. Show me how you live in accordance with your faith, the rest is blah-blah. My faith is very strong and that has helped me a lot. But, as I’m saying, the intermediaries between me and God—I now choose my people. In all religions, there are wonderful people. And in all religions too, there are also scoundrels.Well, I think we have the duty to our children to teach them where they come from. It is a past that’s hard to accept, but what can we do? We’re talking about the transfer between generations of what happened. If the theories that, for example in Jewish communities, second-generation survivors still feel the “effects of the genocide,” are true, then it must be true for our children too. Knowledge has to be passed on, it all depends on how you phrase things. Maybe you have to choose a good moment and little by little make them understand what happened. But it’s difficult to avoid creating, in the future, useless extremists. That’s the difficult thing: how to transmit a message that is pure, authentic, real and without creating unnecessary, dangerous extremism, because all extremists are dangerous. So how can we pass on this heritage so that they understand where they come from and in a way that, perhaps, gets them to fight the evil as soon as it begins to appear elsewhere or within others, and without necessarily venturing into extremism. All the while being aware, precisely, of where they come from and what had taken place. That’s what is most difficult. But it’s our duty.I think I’m an individual who is part of a lineage. My great-grandparents, my grandparents and my parents made me who I am and they left us something tangible: the [estate?], so to speak. I\\'ve been there, everything they’ve left us there is intact, it’s wild with vegetation, but it’s intact. I think that growing old there would be a great challenge, to carry on the family line and to pass my testimony, so to speak, on to Jean-Blanchard and the other children.  It would be unfortunate if those who wanted to exterminate an entire nation would be able to say: this used to be the place of so-and-so, the same way we now point to Nyagakecuru’s property on the summit of Mount Huye—there are no children, he has no descendants. I am alive, I have to go back home one of these days, and I also think that’s what they are thinking [points to his nephews]. I would like to build a house there and grow old in it. But on the other hand, aging without being cut with a machete [laughs]—can that be guaranteed? But all in all, I think it was the best option, to continue this legacy so that it endures, yes.I don’t think we can complete this process, because the act of a genocide is written in letters of blood and fire that remain indelible and… We have the duty to remember, but when we think about memory we also have to think about everything that memory entails, if you see what I mean. Life must continue except that life does not continue as we think it would, that’s the problem. We live with it, but we make the decision to continue living and that’s why we’re called survivors. So, the mourning of an entire people [silence] is unfortunately now part of the identity of an entire people, on whichever side we are, we can’t escape that so easily. We can’t escape that so easily… If, for example, the genocide of—well, the Jewish people took place primarily in Germany or Poland, in Auschwitz, Treblinka [inaudible] and so on, it didn’t take place in Israel, but the duty to remember is everywhere, even in the United States, in Montreal, Canada. Overcoming this means finding in such barbaric, savage act, in the absolute evil, the tools with which to gather the strength that would allow people to go forward, and that’s possible. And that’s why to say that we can get through and erase [gestures “to erase” with the hand]—that\\'s impossible. But, I think, it’s about refusing destruction in the name of moving forward. And of course the fire that can—the energies that can make us progress towards that future, it is precisely memory and all that it entails, so whether we like it or not, that’s what we have.Well, for me, reconciliation necessarily involves all the actors: the victims as well as the perpetrators of evil. Each actor has a role to play. Meaning: those who have committed the crime must accept that they have done so and must be able to express all the evil they have caused, to name it in full and to assess its depth, its magnitude, and to be able to say that to the person who has suffered.  The individuals who have committed the crime must also—must be open to showing remorse, to demonstrate their impossibility to change the past, to assess rightly that what they have done is beyond repair and that they therefore humbly ask for forgiveness; that they express their repentance in front of the victim for what they have done. Before that, of course, as I was saying, reconciliation begins within one’s self. You have to recreate and revisit the person that you used to be, right? Before making that step, right? So first you have to recover your lost humanity because before dehumanizing the other, the victim, the perpetrator has dehumanized himself because that’s not what he used to be before. To make that step, to recognize the depth and magnitude of the harm that they have caused and to accept that, unfortunately, there are things beyond repair and that to continue living as a nation we must go forward. But irreparable doesn’t mean preventing people from living, but proposing ways and means, if only a minimum of reparation, even just symbolic, to show sincere repentance and recognition of the evil that has been done. On the victim’s side, too, life must continue and it must continue in a more or less normal fashion. To retreat in narcissistic pain is not a solution either. If the victim recognizes the repentance of the executioner as sincere, if the victim understands that the act of repentance is honest, if he understands that, indeed, no reparation is possible, but that nevertheless we must move forward, if he understands that accepting the executioner’s repentance can also make—it helps break open the abscess of resentment, the venom that he has been digesting from the moment the evil was done. I think that being open would help the victim in the process of healing. It would be good for the victim to open up and accept the repentance of the other, not to skip stages in the process, so to speak, but, at least, little by little, these are… It can’t be done in a day, it can’t happen in a year, it will take time, but we must let time do its work. That\\'s why sometimes politicians push an agenda that can’t be pushed. It’s like a small wound, and this wound is internal. If you cut your finger at quarter past ten today, you can’t say, “Okay, at three o’clock I have to be healed.” These things are… Reconciliation requires both sides, absolutely. We can’t either—and this is important—it must be voluntary. Obviously, this also requires education and that, I think, is the great responsibility of our political leaders: to educate the people. But they too must be able to live up to this educational standard because, you see, just because one is a politician doesn’t mean that one is educated, about certain notions, at least. One has to have a good understanding of these things to get people to also understand them well. So, then—unlike forgiveness—forgiveness doesn’t require the presence of both parties even if reconciliation and forgiveness are linked. But forgiveness—I can forgive someone who isn’t present because forgiveness isn’t necessarily a gift given to the other; it’s a gift that one must first give to one’s self because it is in my own interest to break open this abscess and drain the pus that torments me and prevents me from living my life, right? So, I can forgive someone who isn’t present and I can forgive someone without telling them, that’s not their problem When I think to myself, “Starting today, I will erase this debt,” it’s my right to erase it. Okay. I don’t know anyone who says that “forgiving means freeing a person from a prison and then realizing that the prisoner was in fact one’s own self.” So I must forgive first for my own self before I do the same for someone else. We can forgive without reconciling if the person is not there, but we can’t be reconciled without both parties being present, that’s impossible. That’s why the survivors ask the same question: “Who do I have to reconcile with since no one showed up?” That’s it!Okay, if the culprit doesn’t want to ask for forgiveness, no one can forgive for him. But if the culprit is not present, and his child asks for forgiveness, this means that through a process of education the child has understood that he can’t act, he can’t repeat the [parent’s] act. One can’t forgive through an intermediary while the culprit refuses to accept repentance. For me, that’s impossible. If someone says, “What my parents have done—and they didn’t have time to ask for forgiveness, but I’m absolutely certain that had they been here… And I’m here on their behalf and I am asking for your forgiveness.” In this way, there is at least an assurance that if this individual is asking for forgiveness in an honest and sincere manner, he wouldn’t repeat his parent’s actions. But if someone says, “Well, we have to finish the work” and his son comes up to me and says: “You have to forgive my father who is in the forests of Congo or elsewhere…” Well, listen, that makes no sense.Well, there is the effort of personal reflection that needs to be done and to come back to one’s own self, to define one’s self from before the act took place: “Who was I before?” Because there are three stages: before, during and after. Does the way a person behaves during the action determine the way a person will be after? So he says to himself: “Now I’m a criminal” or he goes into complete denial and always finds excuses for his actions, you see? To justify the unjustifiable, he finds reasons that are difficult to accept, it’s like the myth of Cain! So, you see, he’s trying to find a valid reason, but it’s not working at all, it will never be a genuinely valid reason because it eats him from the inside. That\\'s why we say in Kinyarwanda and Kirundi: “You can run faster than the one chasing you, but you can’t outrun the one who’s running within you,” you see what I mean? So, how to remove that which is running within you? It is precisely to recognize what it is that is running within you. And before this thing ran within you, was that you? You see? How can I, before making the other two steps, return to that pervious state and say, “No, that’s unacceptable! I have to return to who I was before and rediscover my humanity.” But to go back to this humanity, one must also accept the inhumanity one has attained, either by oneself or by what you have learned from human experience, you see? So, the whole process of repentance begins with a personal conviction, to convince one’s self that: “Well, that\\'s unacceptable, I did it, but I wasn’t like that before. How can I go back to who I was before? I can’t deny what I’ve done.” That’s it.Well, I don’t know if there are other things I\\'d like to share, except that I think that we still have a very, very long journey to go as a nation, and that what we are seeing here, outside of Rwanda, between Rwandans, is only a [inaudible: habit?], in fact, a summary, say, or a simplified form of what is happening within each person, within every Rwandan, elsewhere, in Rwanda or elsewhere. So, wherever we are, we—every Rwandan wherever he is, should be aware that if we ever want to become Rwandans again, we have to go through a very long process of education, of self-education, and to personally make the decision to become what we must become. We must not be forced to do anything, we must first believe in what we want to be.Yes, I think it’s [inaudible] because in the Rwandan community, in the diaspora, we have, quote-unquote, “friends” who love us to death, and I say “to death”—they are extremists who aren’t necessarily Rwandans, who claim to love us, but who only wish our death—who find other reasons to justify the genocide and even those who have committed the genocide are starting to flee. No, it’s unacceptable! There are people, non-Rwandans, who claim to love us, but who actually hate us more than those who carried out the genocide. How to justify the unjustifiable—it happened in Rwanda and they are not fools; some of them are politicians, intellectuals, they are people who go to—who explain why it happened the way it happened, and who dare write things that even the devil couldn’t imagine: how are we going to solve the problem these people are causing, I don’t know. Frankly, I don’t know at all. We don’t need this kind of people, we don’t need them at all—let them take care of their own frustrations and I think that’s what drives them to justify the unjustifiable. But they should leave us, give us the chance to move forward in our own way, as we were before, despite all the dehumanizing acts that have taken place. That’s all I have to say.I remember really well my maternal grandparents. I didn’t know my paternal grandfather, because, as far as I know, he died when I was a little child, or even before I was born. But I knew my maternal grandmother who also died when I was—if I remember correctly—10 years old. So I remember her vaguely, yeah.Whether I think about my maternal grandparents or my paternal grandmother, I remember the summer vacations, because we went there every summer. I remember how impatiently they waited for us and I remember especially the traditional dishes that they would make for us, even if we didn’t like eating that food very much. But they would prepare them with so much love… That\\'s the memory I have engraved in my mind—how they wanted to make us happy, even though I— [laughs] I didn’t like the food very much, but it’s something that I remember, yeah.I know that Mom was her dad\\'s favourite. [laughs] Other than that—well, it was a pretty normal relationship.As I mentioned, we visited them every year and every time someone I knew was going to their house, I always took the time to write each one of them a letter, telling them how I was doing, how my life was going, asking them for news about themselves. I know I took the time to do this at least three times a year.I would say that as parents they were very strict. [laughs] I don’t know how you say that in French—the kind of parents who would look at you from the corner of their eye and, without them having to say anything, you would know what mistake you’ve made and you would correct the mistake at the same time. It was—in any case, I think—not that I regret it, but I think we had a very strict upbringing.Yes, we were spoiled as children, but that didn’t mean that we weren’t punished when we made mistakes. But when we weren’t causing any trouble, we were pampered. We ate out at the restaurant at least once a week, on Saturday nights. We rented movies—not during the week because those were school nights. And we went to the park on Saturday evenings. We went on airplane tours. We were more than spoiled, I would say.I started kindergarten when I was three years old and when I was five, I think, I started elementary school. I finished it at 12. I started high school at the age of 13. So, the first four years of school was the common core education, without specialization. Later, when I started fifth grade—since I was in a high school in Benin—we had to choose a specialization in fifth, sixth and seventh grade, and I continued in accounting.In the neighbourhood, I would say that what “well-to-do” meant was relative, but we were—some families were richer, others poorer, so I would say ours was maybe in the middle. At school we were—I went to school with the children of ministers and so on, so I would say that my classmates’ families were much better-off than us.I’ll express my personal opinion about this. I’d say that it wasn’t only a question of education in the sense that parents didn’t want their children to socialize with—I’d say, with just anyone… I think they were also concerned about the children’s safety. These are the two reasons that come to mind.Actually, after the genocide, the NGO where my mother worked opened a branch in Benin. I don’t know how it happened and my mom had to—in any case, she was transferred from Rwanda to Benin and we had to leave with her.The moment that always comes to my mind is when my mother told us we were leaving. She told us—because we were going to school at the time, I think it had been a few weeks since the beginning of the school year—she told us, “You’ll have to study French harder, because in your new school you’ll be studying in French only.” The idea of leaving was exciting to me, but the fact that I was going to be in a school, in an environment where we only spoke French and that maybe I wouldn’t be able to express myself correctly was scaring me. Apart from that, the other [?] was leaving the people I’ve grown up with, my cousins, and knowing that I wouldn’t be able to see them anytime I wanted, that was also bothering me a little. But I was delighted by the idea of \\u200b\\u200bchange and exploring something new.For sure, the beginning was difficult for me and my brothers and sister precisely on account of the language because we were in a place where we didn’t speak the language, so it wasn’t easy. We arrived in January, so right in the middle of the school year, and we had to adapt, stay on track, learn French, adapt and at the same time not fall behind, which was much more difficult. It was also a cultural shock, because these are two completely different cultures, and settling down was difficult too. But I don’t know if it was because we were young or because I myself was young, but I’d say that it didn’t take too long before I felt almost at home there.Yes, I remember that when I arrived in the school I was introduced to the students in my class, and everyone was trying hard to help me, to explain things, to give me their notes to copy, and this felt good because when you go someplace new, you feel quite—you think to yourself, “Will everything be okay?” and all that. But when people would come up to me at recess and say, “Don’t worry, you can copy my notes”—the teachers would also come up to me and say, “Come to see me if you need explanations”—that was reassuring. But the fact that we were far from our family, far away, and that we didn’t know almost anyone there, that part wasn’t easy.[laughs] I still wonder to this day. Because not only she was working and taking care of the children, I think it also fell on her to do the greatest share of the work of finding out how things functioned in the new place. To this day, I don’t understand how she did it, with four children. If I were in her place, I don’t think I would have succeeded. I’m still asking myself this. I think she is the right person to ask this question to.Not just from my mom [?]. But from her I think I have that go-getter attitude, I must have inherited that from her. The resourcefulness, always wanting to go forward despite the obstacles on the way—this comes, I’m sure, from my mother. Another trait is the love for Rwandan culture—that, I think, one hundred percent is from her, one hundred percent. That little bit of calm disposition that I have, I think it’s from my mom too… [laughs] Reading—I don’t remember if my dad liked to read much, but I know my mom loves it, so I have that from her as well.From Dad? First, him being a doctor, he was more interested in mathematics, chemistry, things like that and so I must have gotten that from my dad. Apparently, my dad also had a strong character, so that too must come from him… What else? The side of me that wants success not only for myself but for the people around me as well, the side that likes to help others, the generous side—that, I think, I also carry from my dad.I’d say that when experiencing such atrocities I don’t think you make the effort to think about what will happen tomorrow, you live day-by-day. Actually, not even day-by-day, you live in the present moment, really, and you wait to see what happens next.I think that even me, even though I was young, I saw some signs, but I could have never, ever imagined that such a thing would happen.Yes, they would ask the students from one ethnic group to get up, they would count them and tell them to sit back down and then ask the students from the other ethnic group to get up, and so on. And there was a form we had to fill in and we had to indicate our ethnicity, our names, our parents’ names, where we were born and so on and the question about ethnicity was also on there…I don’t know how I came to know it, but I did [laughs], I knew it. It\\'s a form that we’ve had to fill in since we were young, when we were in kindergarten, I think, we were given that form to fill in at home and bring back. And when we were in elementary school we would fill it in ourselves, and if we didn’t know how to fill in certain parts, we had to ask our parents and the next day we would bring the missing information to our teacher.Personally, I was too young, I didn’t notice that. It’s possible that was the case, but personally I didn’t realize it.How do you mean?So, how it happened… I remember, it started in the evening, we were having dinner, it was around 8 o’clock in the evening, my paternal uncle was there with us, on his vacation. We were at the table, having dinner, and then we heard the sound of the plane. I didn’t realize it was the sound of the plane because we were always hearing that kind of noise, grenades, here and there, and I thought that it was just the usual. Then my father asked us to go to bed—actually, not to bed but to go under the beds, because every time this happened, we were told to hide under the bed until my parents would come and tell us to… And then, a few minutes later, we were told: “Come out from under the bed and go to sleep.” Then they woke us up only the next day—because I was getting ready—I remember, I was preparing to write the final exam at the end of high school [Translator’s note: or elementary school?] and I was taking classes—it was Easter vacation, but I was taking extra classes to prepare for my exam. So when they came to wake us up, I got up quickly to go take a shower, because I thought I was late for school. And my dad followed me and said “No, you’re not going to school today.” Then I saw that they were laying down mattresses in the corridor, and my father told us, “Sit down, we\\'ll explain what\\'s going on.” So they laid the mattresses down, they arranged all that and said, “In fact, the president\\'s plane has been shot down and things are not going well at all for the moment, we\\'re going to stay here until the situation improves.” I was so young that I didn’t understand how great the danger was. I said, “So I\\'m not going to school?” My father said, “No, you’re not going to school until things get better.” I said, “Okay, no problem.” And so we stayed in the house. The plane was shot down on the 6th at night and we stayed there until the 11th. It was on the 11th that we were attacked in the house. I remember that when it happened my father went out, we stayed behind—no—yes, we stayed behind—my mom and my brothers, my sister and uncle. Just before he went out, my father said, “Let’s sit together and pray.” We took a few minutes to pray and then my father went out of the house. My mother told me to get my brothers and sister and go hide under my parents’ bed, then she closed the door and said, “I\\'ll come to get you soon.” We stayed there, but I could hear noises, there were noises. I remember I came out from under the bed and I went to the window. I saw my father being struck, and I went back under the bed. But I didn’t say anything to my brothers, I was speechless. A few minutes later, someone entered the room. My sister said, “Daddy is back.” But it wasn’t our dad, it was someone else. He started searching, rummaging around the room… And when he looked under the bed—there we were. He told us to come out, and so we did, he told us to go outside, and we followed. So we were there and I didn’t know what had happened to my mother, I didn’t know how my father was doing, and all that. I didn’t know what had happened to my uncle or to the servants either. We were standing in front and then the man asked me, “Are you the eldest child in the family?” I said, “Yes, I\\'m the eldest.” He said, “Where do your parents keep the money, the guns, and all that?” I said I didn’t know, I said that I had never seen any guns in the house. I said that I really didn’t know. I told him, “You can ask Mom or Dad, I don’t know.” Then he began to tease me: “Oh, those rich kids, it’s always the same thing.” He told many stories and then he said: “Anyway, it doesn’t matter if you know or not. We’ll kill all of you and then we’ll search the house and we’ll find it.” I said, “I can’t tell you anything because I don’t know.” Then he told me, “Before we kill you, you’ll take this gun and you will kill your brothers.” I told him, “I don’t know how to use a gun,” that\\'s what I said. And he said, “Oh yes, you do know. You, the inkotanyi children, you all know how to use guns.” So he handed the gun over to me, I remember that it was very heavy. He said, “So, there, you’re going to kill them quickly, then we’ll kill you, then we\\'ll get on with what we need to do, and then we’ll leave.” I remember that he gave me the gun and I gave it back and said, “Look, do what you want, I can’t kill my brothers.” The man said, “Oh no? In any case, if you don’t kill them, we’ll kill you all.” And I said, “Do what you want, I’m not going to kill my brothers.” So he stayed there and a few minutes later, my mom came out of the house accompanied by somebody else, I think he was the leader of the whole gang. They came out and he said to the guy who was with us, “Leave them alone, I made an arrangement with the lady, let them go. I don’t think they’ll go far, anyway…” So my mother said to me, “We’re going to the neighbours’.” We passed through the fence and we went to the neighbours’ house. Of course, when they had heard that we were being attacked, they had fled, so when we got there, the house was empty. Meanwhile, I think they had told my mother that my father was dead and my mother could not stop crying, and we didn’t understand why… We kept asking her, “Mom, what is it? What\\'s wrong?” And she kept saying, “It\\'s going to be all right, it\\'s going to be all right.” [Tears] [Temporary break in the recording] Afterwards, when my mother—my mom calmed down later and she told us, “Your father is dead.” In the meantime, while my mother was out, my uncle had also left. They had tried to cut off his arm and he was bleeding; we tried to stop the blood with a cloth. We stayed in the house, we waited for the neighbours to come back, we just stayed there, and then, much later, they returned. So the man—in the house where we were—he said, “You can’t stay here because they know you’re here, and if they know it, we’re next.” And then even I said, “Where do you think I can go with the kids?” He begged us to leave and then he said, “Okay, no problem, you can sleep here tonight, but tomorrow morning you’ll have to start making arrangements and see where you can go.” So, we went to bed and I think that during the night, my mother and my uncle went to the neighbours’ to see if there was a place for us to stay, but—and I found that out the next day—that plan didn’t work. And I know that in the house where we were, the whole family was about to leave and go to Butare. So Mom asked them, “Can you take us with you?” But the man said, “Listen, we can’t,” and so on. My mother then asked if they could at least drop us off at the house of my mother’s older brother who lived in Kiyovu. Then suddenly it started to rain. It was raining heavily. Now that it was raining, the man said, it was certain that the guards at the roadblocks would leave their posts and so we could go, but he would only drive us to my uncle’s. So we got to my uncle’s house, we knocked on the door, we knocked, we knocked and there was no one… Fortunately, there was a small opening at the bottom of the fence. My mom said to me: “Go and see if there’s anyone in the house.” I passed through and I went upstairs. My uncle and his family weren’t there, only the guard whom I knew and who said: “Listen, unfortunately, you can’t stay here because there is someone watching the neighbourhood and he knows that there are two of us here in the house, if they find you here, they’ll kill us all.” So I went back and told that to my mom and the others. In the meantime, my mother had an idea—my uncle’s family had a friend who worked at the Belgian Red Cross, which was not too far away. So Mom said, “You’re going to drop us off there and the Red Cross probably—they will shelter us.” So, they dropped us off there and they left. Once we arrived, we asked for the friend of my uncle’s family, he came out, saw us—he knew us—and he said: “Unfortunately, they don’t shelter refugees here.” He said, “There’s another branch of the Belgian Red Cross further down, we will send you there.” My mom said: “With all the roadblocks, we won’t be able to pass through.” And he said, “Okay.” He took one of the cars of the Red Cross, we got in, and he said, “Listen, we\\'re going to pass through as if we”—we were hidden at the back of the car—“we\\'re going to pretend that it’s a Red Cross vehicle passing… If they stop us, unfortunately there is nothing we can do, but if they don’t stop us, great.” But it was still raining so every time we came up to a roadblock, it was empty, so we passed through and they left us there. They dropped us off at the Red Cross and there were other refugees living there, about sixty or so people, families, and so on. So they left us there and that’s where we stayed. In the beginning, everything went well, we had food to eat, but sometimes there wasn’t any food left and they told us that we would divide the work by family. Each family—they said that we were going to have a schedule of people who would do the cleaning, people who would do the dishes, people who would cook—who would go get food, people who would go get water. Because I was the eldest in the family, I was told, no problem, I can help with the cooking, but for those going out—my mom couldn’t go out, and so they said, “Look, you\\'re the eldest, you have no choice.” I said, “Okay.” Anyway, I was young—getting water? No problem! But we had to get water for bathing, for washing the dishes, for cooking. So I said, “Listen, I don’t mind going, but how will I manage?” They said, “No problem, we’ll think of something.” Then they said, “We\\'ll do two rounds because not everyone can go out at the same time.” And since they designated only one family member per activity, I said: “I’ll go out in the first round and will come back in the second, it’s not a problem.” Someone was surveilling the neighbourhood. Apparently, they were going to kill us at the very end, after they had finished killing everyone else, we were to be the dessert, that\\'s why—because no one was protecting us at the Red Cross, and there was this man who told us that they were going to kill us in the end. There was a roadblock right at the entrance of the Red Cross; so every time we went out to get water, this man accompanied us, we would get water and come back. So I would leave with the first group, give the water to my mom and come back with the second group, and so on. One day we went out and they started shooting at us. When shots are fired, everyone starts running here and there. I remember I ran, I went into a house, I didn’t know where I was, I climbed a tree and sat there and waited. They were shooting, shooting, shooting... At one point, I don’t know what happened, but the shooting stopped. Quietly, I climbed back down from where I was, in the tree, and I was looking for the man because I knew that he was going to protect me—and I had been tracking his movements with my eyes. So when everything calmed down, I climbed down and followed the man. Everybody came out of their hiding places except one guy who was shot and we took him back to the Red Cross. After that, we just continued on our way to get water and then we returned to the house. I think my mother was scared and she said: “I don’t think you’ll be going alone next time.” So from then on, my brother went with me. And we continued going as usual. One morning, apparently someone from the Red Cross had fired bullets at the roadblock at the entrance. So the interahamwe came and said: “We won’t wait until the end, after all.” We were all taken out of the house, we were taken outside and they said: “Say your prayers now, we will kill you.” We were all sitting in a row, I remember I was with my mom and I don’t know where my sister and my brothers were, but in any event, we were the last ones in the row. I don’t remember where my brothers were. We started praying, and then they killed the first person in the line, I think it was a mother with her baby, then the second, and then the man who was surveilling the neighbourhood showed up. He said, “But why are you killing these people?” And they said, “Wasn’t it them who shot at us?” The man said, “No, no, no, I know this house, I’ve searched it, there are no guns here,” and stuff like that. Anyway, he said, “I told you, we’ll kill these people towards the end.” And so they let us go, we went back into the house. This happened, I think, twice. The first time, they killed people, but the second time one person was wounded, but no one died. So we stayed there and I continued going out as if that was my normal. I said to Mom, “Don’t worry, I\\'m not going to die.” I don’t know why, but I was sure I wasn’t going to die. All three [Translator’s note: or five?] of us stayed there. I went out every day to fetch water, to get some food with the others. Even when my brothers didn’t come with me, I would still go, because I was sure that nothing was going to happen to me. I went out every day. I saw the killings in some places, but I had gotten to a point where it didn’t shock me anymore, they could shoot someone and I could pass nearby without a problem. As long as they didn’t touch me—that’s what was scaring me. My mother would ask me, “Have you seen the dead people?” And I would say, “They are everywhere.” It has become just a normal thing for me that one person would kill another; I saw a woman being raped and it seemed normal to me. All I was doing was to go out, get water and bring it back, because I didn’t want my family to starve. Then finally, one morning we woke up and the roadblock was gone. Someone looked out the door and the people who were guarding the roadblock were no longer there. Then I think someone turned on the radio—the radio wasn’t working. We wondered what was going on, and, I think as a reflex from the war, we said, “Let’s get ready, something is happening, we should leave.” We got dressed, we started packing a few small things, because we thought we were going to change locations, and while we were getting ready a soldier arrived. I remember my mother cried out, “It’s the inkotanyi.” [laughs] And my mom said, “Don’t take too many things with you because they [the soldiers] have arrived.” I remember I was packing and I was asking, “Mom, should we take this?” She was saying, “No, no, no, don’t worry, we’re safe.” [laughs and tears of joy] And then she said to me and my brothers, “Don’t worry, everything is fine.” I remember we were the second ones to go out, there was one guy in front of us and then me and my mom, and she said, “Go where this gentleman tells you to go, because it’s fine, we’re safe.” [laughs] Then they took us to a place called [inaudible]. Everyone from Kiyovu was there, well, from the neighbourhood anyways. They took us there, they gathered us to tell us that the war was over and that we were going to stay there until they found a safe place for us to go because there were grenades everywhere and it wasn’t safe. I remember that they brought us food, they gave us to eat, and told us that the next morning we were going to Kicukiro. We were to walk from Kiyovu to Kicukiro. I said, “Mom, how are we going to walk?” [laughs] Mom said, “Now that we’ve gotten this far, we’ll do whatever it takes, if we have to walk, you’ll walk.” Mom said, “In any case, don’t take too many things with you because we’re safe and these people will feed us at the place where we’re going.” The next day they told us, “It’s time to go.” We gathered our things, yes, and we set off for Kicukiro. And everyone—each family was assigned to a house. We were told, “This is a safe place, you’ll stay here a few days until we secure the rest of the city.” I think we stayed there for at least—I think a week, the equivalent of a week. After that they said, “You can now go back to your homes.” When we returned to the house—I wasn’t—my mother was accompanied by someone, I don’t know who—apparently, we couldn’t live in our house because it wasn’t a pretty sight—in any case, I didn’t know what it looked like. We were told to go sleep at my aunt’s house. When they had brought us all together in that place, we reunited with one of my aunts. She had lost her children. She was my godmother. She [Yvette’s mother] told us, “You, your sister and your brothers are going to stay with your godmother and I will stay with your other uncle” with whom we had also reunited. “We’ll clean the house and once it’s ready you’ll come too.” I think I stayed with my aunt for two days, the time it took to put the house in order a little bit, and then we returned home.Speaking for myself, I think that it was like the two sides of a mirror: I was a spoiled child who had suddenly become an adult. I realized that life would never be the same. I don’t know how I understood that, but it was like a mirror, yes. We stayed there, we tried to clean the house—the places where there was blood, all the books that were on the floor because they had ransacked everything. We cleaned the house and, fortunately, not long after, the NGO where my mom worked restarted—they opened for business again and Mom had to go back to work. Since I was the eldest in the family, I had to take over the responsibilities of the house, I had to make sure that we had something to eat, I cooked, I cleaned the house… I had to get my brothers organized—I knew that this brother had to get up and clean this room or that brother had to get up and do something else. I knew when we had to go get water and I learned to clean and cook by myself. I was trying to remember what our servants did when I was little and when I was watching them work. I was improvising. In any case, I know that when Mom would come home from work, everything was in order. How did I do it? I don’t know. But I knew that it had to be done, because Mom was working, she couldn’t be in two places at the same time, so I learned all of this by myself. Of course, when Mom was home, I would sit next to her, ask her questions: “How do I do that? How is this done? What do you think I should do tomorrow?” She would tell me, but I knew that I had to take on responsibility for everything to be in order when she came home from work.I think we went back to school—if I remember correctly, it was two months later, I think in October? Yes, I think it was October when we went back to school. Two months later.Yes, I went back to the same school. Of course, I didn’t know 90% of the faces there. I remember there was a girl I went to elementary school with. When I saw her after the war—she was the first one I saw—I think we hugged and we stayed in each other’s arms for a long time because she was the only one I knew from school from before. And to see her alive, it felt good. And I remember there was a teacher who came up to me and said, “No, no, no, you can’t be alive.” I said, “Yes, I\\'m here.” There was also a boy who was back—I remember we were in fifth grade together before the war. I didn’t recognize him because they had cut him all over his body. I didn’t recognize him, and the girl asked me, “Did you recognize Ange?” I said, “That’s Ange? No, I didn’t recognize him.” I felt so bad for not having recognized him, someone who had been part of my life from before, who felt much closer to me after the war than the others, especially those returning from outside of the country—he was like [part of?] my family. Not recognizing him really affected me deeply. But, for sure, when school started, those of us who were in Rwanda after the war, we stuck together. The people who came back from Burundi, they kept their distance. And so did the people who came back from Uganda. That’s how it always was. And I remember our conversations: “How did you survive? What happened? How are you doing? Are your parents still alive? Are your sisters still alive?” That was it, at least for the first two weeks we only talked about that. About nothing else.I think, from the teachers who had taught me before, there was only one at the school after the war. Only one was there. There were five sixth grade classes and we had about five teachers, and I knew only one of them from before.The trauma, that’s it. It was a recurrent thing. You would be studying and all of a sudden you would hear someone scream—things like that. It affected us, but I think it affected the teachers more. They not only had to ensure the well-being of the students, to teach them in class, the class material and all that, the knowledge they had to transmit, but also take care of these children who were not doing very well. So it was a combination of these three things, and I imagine they themselves were not feeling—anyway, I think that, psychologically, they weren’t able to combine these three roles. I guess they had to do it, they had no choice.In elementary school, this teacher—the fact that after the war, he came up to me and said, “You are alive? I\\'m glad you\\'re here.” That touched me. It felt like there was at school, besides my friends, an adult that I knew or at least someone I could talk to, someone who knew me from before. And what he said was reassuring: “If there is anything I can do, I’m here for you, I can help you.” It affected me, but it didn’t—it touched me, but not so deeply. For me, at the time, that wasn’t essential. I told myself that I had to live and the rest was not that important.I could see how my mom was fighting and I was thinking, “If she’s fighting like that, me, as the eldest in the family, I have—,” I thought I had the duty not only to continue going to school in order to succeed, but also in order to help my mom. I was thinking that she couldn’t continue going it alone. That’s what motivated me. And I was also thinking, “I am lucky to still have my mom, there are people who have lost their mothers.” So if I still have her and she is taking care of us, I thought “I have to do the impossible to move forward, to succeed and to lighten her load.” That’s what motivated me, because I remember that before the war, I went to school for the sake of going to school. I remember that if I placed 19th or lower in my class, that was a perfect score for me. As long as I wasn’t 20th, because I thought that being in 20th place was low, but up to 19 was perfect. I had never wanted to be first, second, all that. I wasn’t concerned with this because what mattered for me at school was to see my friends. And since I knew I was going to be scolded at the end of the semester [if I had bad grades], I would do everything I could so as not to be 20th in my class. But after the war, right after the war, I was first in my class because I understood better than before the use of school. That\\'s why I said that before and after was like the two sides of a mirror.No. No, not yet. [laughs] I hope to, someday, but no, I haven’t reached it yet.Speaking for myself? I don’t think I would have the strength to pursue this, I don’t think I have the energy. I appreciate the people in Kigali who follow up on this, it’s good if they do it, but personally, I don’t think I have that energy. The only motivation that would make me do it is to find out where the body of my father is, but the rest—attending the gacaca and all that—it’s good, but I don’t think I have enough energy to do that. Even if I were there, in Rwanda, I don’t think I would have the energy to do it.It\\'s a good question. I don’t know. We think we’d meet them, but meeting someone who says “No, I didn’t do that,” yet we know they have, it’s also—in any case, I am reluctant. I am not so sure. But sometimes I think to myself: “I would like to meet this person and look at him.” To be face-to-face with him, to at least ask him a few questions. But I think it would anger me more, it would make me even more—if he says, “No, I didn’t do that,” I don’t know if I could handle it. Knowing that he’s done it and that he says no, that’s what I doubt very much. I find it’s too—I think it\\'s the highest level of viciousness. We’re not asking for much, we want to know at least where the body is so we can bury it. But to meet with someone who might know where the body is and would not say, I\\'m not sure that I could handle it.I lived there for a few months before going to Benin, but I think I was more—I didn’t really think about what had happened. I was trying hard to look on the bright side, to see my family that I hadn’t seen, my uncles, my aunts, my cousins… I don’t think that—I was trying not to mention it. And to this day, I’m still not sure if I would go back, I don’t know what it would be like.Yes. But when, I don’t know.Whether I like it or not, Rwanda will always remain my country. That\\'s one thing. Two, I still have relatives there. But the other thing that I really want to do one day—and to have the courage to do—is to go, but not only to be there, but to be there in April, that would be ideal. I would like to relive that month as I lived through it in 1994. Maybe it would be a kind of therapy for me, I don’t know, but that\\'s what I\\'m going to do, try to live through—to remember what I was doing every day—or at least live for a few days there during that month.Visit the places, go to the memorials, return to the neighbourhood, yes. All of this is what I would like to do. When? I don’t know.I came to Montreal in 2001. It might sound crazy, but I have always loved Canada. Why? I don’t know. I was hearing Montreal French being spoken, and I had a cousin who lived here and he told me, “Listen, it\\'s nice here, it\\'s good, you\\'ll enjoy it, come.” When I arrived, I came for—I said, “I\\'ll try it for maybe a year. If I like it I\\'ll stay, if I don’t like it, too bad.” And now, it’s been almost nine years. [laughs]Yes, I would say yes, I loved it.I think it was hard for her to let me go because it was the first time she was separating from one of her children. I don’t think she realized it until the last day or maybe she was hoping I would come back. But I was thinking, “Not being next to her doesn’t mean that I’m not helping her.” And I was also thinking: “I want to go there, I want to leave for—.” As the saying goes, you have to take a step backwards in order to make a better jump forward. In my mind, that’s why I did it. It was crazy, because I was young and I didn’t have a precise plan and all that, but it was really with the intention to move forward and become someone, to be able to reach my goals, that was the reason why. It was really a crazy thing to do, leave your parents while you are still under 18, go to Canada, a country, I don’t know how many thousands—from your parents, it\\'s crazy. I don’t think that my children would do something like that. [laughs]Because I was with my cousin, I had someone who was helping me do this and that. That was helpful. Also I was still a minor and I went back to high school. That was easy. That\\'s what made my integration easier because when you start school, you make contacts. I started school, I was at the end of high school, so I finished high school. And I remember, I started in Grade 10 and when the school year finished everyone was looking for work and so I said “Let\\'s go! Let’s find a job.” I remember I didn’t know where to start. I remember I was buying something at Zellers and there was a line-up, a long line. And I thought, “These people are probably looking for cashiers.” [laughs] I went home, printed my CV, went back to the store, gave it to them and said, “I think you\\'re looking to hire people.” I told this to the person there because there was a long queue. And it was true. I handed in my CV, say today, and two days later they called me, they interviewed me and I started work on Monday. So I worked there during the summer and in September I went back to school. They kept me working part-time because I was going to school. I went to school in the mornings and I was working a few evenings and on the weekend. There was a project with the Bank of Montreal [BMO] through my school, the bank wanted to integrate young students into the financial sector. So they would go into Montreal schools and select a maximum of three students per school, and they chose me. After they selected me, I did the internship once a week. I worked at the bank as an intern and I learned in this way what the job of the people at the bank entailed. And when I graduated from high school, they called me to ask if I was looking for a job. I said yes. The woman who was coordinating the internship told me, “I’ll keep your CV, if you’re ever looking for a job.” And when they had a job opening she said to me: “Listen, there are jobs that have become available, I\\'m going to send your CV, so expect us to call you if you are selected.” Finally, they called me and I got the job at BMO, and I worked there. So that was it, my integration.I was at École secondaire La voie and it wasn’t so difficult because I understood the language, people were speaking and I could understand very well what they were saying. It wasn’t that difficult. Except for my shyness, which always gets in the way... But it was—I was doing so well that in the second year I was president of the student council, which probably means that if they had chosen me, I must have done pretty well, I’d think. No, it wasn’t that hard. I would say it was easier than the first time, but I’d also say that the language facilitated things, because I understood the language, so I went [inaudible].It was easier, yes. It was really multicultural, it\\'s true. But I remember that the assistant director there also helped me a lot, because she would often stop by to ask me if everything was going okay: “Are you having any problems?” I think she came to see me every day, and I found that also reassuring… When there’s someone you can turn to if something goes wrong, I think that also reassured me, yes.I don’t think that she did the same thing for everyone, but in any case not a day went by without me seeing her—I don’t remember. Of course there were days when she wasn’t there, when we had activities, but especially in the beginning, she would see me every day. She would stand in front of her office, you know, and when the students came out of class and when I passed by I would say hello, she would call me and ask, “Are you okay, are there any problems?”, things like that… She was my resource person, if I had any questions.Yes, to the assistant director—I didn’t go into too many details, but I told her that I was Rwandan. She asked me if I had lived through the genocide, I said yes, that was all. But I remember one time, it was during history class I think, we were talking about wars and all that, and they asked me to tell them what had happened in Rwanda. And again, I didn’t go into details, but I told them what had happened, and I said a few words about my own experience, so yeah, I’ve told the story at least once.It certainly changes something when you know what someone has lived through, especially if it has been something difficult. As long as we don’t gloss over it and we don’t feel sorry the person… But for sure, it changes something.I did, I participated in one organization. I participated once. If I remember correctly, it was during the first summer, I was already working, and there was a youth centre across the street from where I worked, and I said to myself, “I’ll go and see what they’re doing there,” and I went in. They said that, yes, they do activities to help young people integrate and out of curiosity I said, “I’ll join in.” I was—we were a group of young people, yes, we did some activities, we did small jobs. I didn’t stay long, I think I stayed only for the two months in the summer. I was just curious to see what they were doing.No, not at all. Not really.It\\'s a dance group where we do traditional Rwandan dances and other activities. We have a community newspaper, we organize Christmas parties for the children, and so on. And I’ve been part of Insangano, I think, since 2003—no, 2004—I’ve been part of Insangano. I’m also part of Page-Rwanda, since 2005–2006, so those are the two community groups to which—I was also a member of the founding committee of the Rwandan Cultural Centre, and I think that’s all.I know there’s another dance group, Ihozo. But I don’t know much more about them. But I know they exist.Does one have to be Rwandan to notice it? Because I am Rwandan, I don’t know if people who see—but as a Rwandan, yes, I am aware of it. Does one have to absolutely be [Rwandan] to understand it? I don’t know. Maybe yes, I don’t know.I think it’s just group dynamics. Bringing together the two ethnicities is not something that can happen in two years or five years. If it is to happen at all, it will take time and there will be a learning curve, and it will be long-lasting. I don’t think it\\'s something that should be forced or pushed either, we really have to let time do its work.No, I would say they have changed, especially when I look at the young people. The young people have the desire to make sure that our country advances. We want things to be better for the country, we really want it to move forward, we want the Rwanda of tomorrow to be a different Rwanda from the one we have known.Yes, there is the Urumuri Mothers Association, I imagine that they also do this kind of gatherings, yes. But that’s all I know.I left BMO not long after 2003, and since then I have been with Bell, since 2003, and I continued my studies in accounting, management and accounting. I think I will be working more in the financial sector.I don’t think it’s been a failure, but I think—I hope—that I\\'m on the right track. There is still a long journey ahead of me.When I watch movies about genocides—of course, a film can’t tell the full story of what happened during those three months and all over the country—does it represent it really or are we trying to represent reality… I think more work remains to be done on this.Personally, no. I can give ideas on a project that someone else would like to carry out, but I don’t think I have the talent for that. One never knows, but for the moment, I don’t think so.The future is based on the past. This means that, whether I like it or not, what happened is going to influence what I am doing now and what I will be doing in the future. This means that what I have seen and what I have lived through will be reflected in my every decision or every action. And I think to myself that, yes, what I’ve lived through was an atrocity, but at the same time it awoke a part of me that keeps telling me that life did not stop, life goes on and that we must not just survive, we must live. Whatever the obstacles you encounter in life, whoever you meet on your journey, don’t hesitate to move forward. And I think—as they say in English, last but not least—I think that if I am who I am, if I am where I am, it is all because of God. And I say to myself, “Everything I\\'ve lived through, everything I do, everything I know—if I didn’t have God, if I didn’t have prayer, I wouldn’t be here.” There’s no doubt about that.'"

       " 'I was behaving like an academic should, like what I was used to doing in Belgium and I think that in a way, I was telling him: “Listen, Séraphin … when you consider … you are an academic, when you consider everything that’s happening in this country and there are journalists and people who write about our country—you have to give good advice to your brother.” Some things are unacceptable.',\n",
       " 'For example, when professors in a university like this one can go as far as be afraid even of a driver[?',\n",
